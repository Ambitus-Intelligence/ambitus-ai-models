This innovative approach, where groceries and essential items are delivered in under 10 minutes, began as a novel concept but has rapidly evolved into a substantial business model. Central to this growth is the Zepto business model and digital marketing strategy, which has played a vital role in building the brand and driving customer engagement.\\\\nIt’s true – Companies like Zepto are at the forefront of this revolution, with even major corporations like Reliance recognising the potential and getting involved. However, despite its rapid expansion, the quick commerce industry faces considerable challenges, especially in terms of profitability.\\\\nThis article delves into how companies like Zepto are striving for success, the obstacles they encounter, and what the future might hold.\\\\nBut before we get into it, a quick side note – If you’re the kind of person who loves decoding marketing strategies, exploring digital marketing masters courses or enrolling in an online digital marketing course can provide valuable insights into this dynamic field.\\\\nLearn Digital Marketing for FREE\\\\n- 45 Mins Masterclass\\\\n- Watch Anytime, Anywhere\\\\n- 1,00,000+ Students Enrolled\\\\nSo, What is Quick Commerce?\\\\nQuick commerce, or Q-commerce, revolves around delivering products like groceries at lightning speed—typically within 30 minutes. The success of this model hinges on dark stores which are small warehouses strategically located close to customers. These warehouses typically store popular items that can be dispatched rapidly.\\\\nFor example, when you order everyday essentials like bread, eggs, and milk, a nearby dark store can have these items packed and en route to you within minutes. This sets quick commerce apart from traditional online shopping, where products may take days to arrive as they are shipped from distant warehouses.\\\\nThe business model of Zepto heavily depends on this approach, with dark stores being crucial for ensuring fast delivery times. This quick turnaround is a fundamental aspect of the Zepto grocery business model, which prioritises speed and convenience to attract customers.\\\\nIf you’re interested in how business models are developed, consider reading our digital marketing blogs and digital marketing case studies.\\\\nHow Dark Stores Work\\\\nDark stores serve as the foundation of quick commerce, enabling the rapid delivery of products. Unlike traditional grocery stores that serve walk-in customers, dark stores are dedicated exclusively to fulfilling online orders.\\\\nTypically located within 1.5 to 4 kilometres of the customers they serve, these stores are optimised for fast, efficient service.\\\\nFor instance, if you live in a bustling neighbourhood, there’s likely a dark store nearby stocked with everyday items. Once you place an order, the products are quickly picked, packed, and dispatched—often within minutes. This process is streamlined by advanced technology that assists workers in these stores to complete orders efficiently.\\\\nThe Zepto business model pdf available online provides a comprehensive overview of how these dark stores operate and how they contribute to the overall efficiency of the business. Understanding the Zepto business model is essential for anyone looking to explore the quick commerce sector.\\\\nP.S. Want to become a digital marketer or work in e-commerce? Enrolling in digital marketing classes or one of the best online marketing courses can equip you with the necessary skills to succeed in this fast-paced industry.\\\\nMaking Quick Commerce Profitable\\\\nRunning a dark store is not without its costs. Setting up such a store can range from ₹25 to ₹40 lakh, with each store requiring a staff of around 13 to 14 employees. In this industry, the average order value is between ₹350 and ₹400, with gross profit margins typically ranging from 15% to 20%.\\\\nHowever, achieving profitability is challenging. Gross profit represents the revenue generated before accounting for expenses like rent, salaries, and delivery costs.\\\\nFor instance, if the delivery cost of an order is ₹40 and the gross profit is ₹80, the net profit is only ₹40. This underscores the importance of careful cost management in the quick commerce industry.\\\\nThis meticulous approach to managing costs and operations is a cornerstone of the Zepto revenue model, which has enabled the company to scale rapidly in a competitive market. The efficiency of the Zepeto business model (often misspelt as “Zepeto”) is what distinguishes it from traditional retail models.\\\\nFun fact: If you’re aiming to build a profitable business, studying various business models, especially those regarded as the most profitable business in India, can offer valuable insights. Zepto’s success story provides a blueprint for what works in the Indian market.\\\\nThe Challenges of Quick Commerce\\\\n1) Balancing Costs and Profits\\\\nOne of the primary challenges facing quick commerce companies is maintaining sufficient profit margins. Even major players like D-Mart report profit margins of only around 16%.\\\\nFor companies like Zepto, which incur additional costs for rapid deliveries, achieving and maintaining profitable margins is particularly challenging.\\\\nConducting a Zepto SWOT analysis is crucial for understanding the company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and potential risks. This analysis can reveal areas where the company excels and where it may need to improve.\\\\nFor instance, a Zepto SWOT analysis might highlight the company’s proficiency in fast delivery while also identifying challenges related to customer acquisition costs.\\\\n2) Competing with Local Stores\\\\nMany consumers have a local store within walking distance that offers free delivery. If quick commerce companies cannot deliver quickly or fail to maintain product freshness, customers may prefer to shop locally.\\\\nFor example, if Zepto takes more than 30 minutes to deliver groceries, a customer might opt to visit the nearby store instead. This competition from local stores is a significant challenge for quick commerce companies.\\\\nHowever, the Zepto marketing strategy has been instrumental in overcoming this challenge. By emphasising the convenience and speed of their services, the Zepto marketing campaign has successfully drawn in a large customer base.\\\\nThe effectiveness of the Zepto digital marketing strategy has been crucial in retaining customer loyalty despite stiff competition.\\\\nIf you’re looking to explore digital marketing in greater detail, consider taking digital marketing courses in Mumbai or digital marketing courses in Faridabad. Both cities offer highly regarded courses in this field.\\\\nAlternatively, digital marketing courses in Thrissur are also an excellent choice if you’re based in southern India.\\\\n3) Customer Habits and Order Size\\\\nQuick commerce apps are frequently used for small, spontaneous purchases. For example, someone making a sandwich might order just bread, cheese, and tomatoes. These small orders make it challenging for companies to turn a profit. If companies try to impose a minimum order value, they risk diminishing the convenience factor that attracts users to quick commerce in the first place.\\\\nTo address this, the Zepto promotion strategy often includes discounts and special offers that encourage customers to add additional items to their carts, thus boosting the average order value. This strategy is a key part of the Zepto business plan aimed at boosting profitability.\\\\nUnderstanding consumer behaviour and the role of AI in this process is becoming increasingly important. Exploring the role of AI in content creation can offer insights into how companies like Zepto can personalise marketing strategies to better meet customer needs.\\\\n4) New Competitors\\\\nNew apps are emerging that offer similar services by connecting customers directly with local stores. For instance, ‘My Kirana’ in Pune allows customers to order from their local kirana stores via an app, ensuring fast delivery without the need to use Zepto. These apps pose a potential threat by taking away customers from established quick commerce platforms.\\\\nThe Future of Quick Commerce\\\\nOpportunities and Risks\\\\nThe quick commerce industry holds great promise but also faces significant challenges. Companies that can effectively address these challenges—by controlling delivery costs, increasing order sizes, and competing with local stores—are poised to become major players in the retail industry.\\\\nThe long-term success of Zepto will depend on its ability to adapt and refine its strategies. As the market continues to evolve, the business model of Zepto must remain flexible to respond to new opportunities and challenges.\\\\nCould Big Companies Take Over?\\\\nThere is also the possibility that large corporations like Reliance or D-Mart might acquire quick commerce companies like Zepto. These giants have the resources and supply chains to run such services more efficiently. For instance, if Reliance were to acquire Zepto, it could leverage Zepto’s delivery network to distribute its own products faster and at a lower cost.\\\\nShould such an acquisition occur, the Zepto marketing strategy would likely be significantly enhanced, integrating seamlessly with the extensive resources of a company like Reliance. This could potentially revolutionise the way quick commerce operates.\\\\nFor those interested in understanding how such market shifts could play out, attending afree LinkedIn essentials masterclass or exploring a free top paying skills course could provide valuable insights.\\\\nWant to Know Why 2,50,000+ Students Trust Us?\\\\nDive into the numbers that make us the #1 choice for career success\\\\nCourses Recommended for you\\\\nAditya Shastri leads the Business Development segment at IIDE and is a seasoned Content Marketing expert.

Dark Stores\\\\n- Zepto operates a network of dark stores, which are small warehouses strategically located in densely populated urban areas.\\\\n- These dark stores are optimized for speed, with AI and machine learning used to ensure efficient inventory management, storage, and order fulfillment.\\\\n- The proximity of these dark stores to customer locations enables the company to meet its delivery promises.\\\\nb. Hyperlocal Delivery\\\\n- Zepto uses a hyperlocal delivery model, which involves sourcing products from dark stores closest to the customer.\\\\n- Its algorithm-based delivery system ensures optimal route planning and efficient utilization of delivery personnel.\\\\nc. App-Based Ordering\\\\n- The Zepto app is designed for simplicity, allowing users to quickly browse, select, and order from a wide range of groceries and essentials.\\\\n- The app also personalizes the shopping experience by leveraging customer data to recommend frequently purchased items.\\\\nZepto Key Revenue Streams\\\\nDespite offering free or low-cost delivery to customers, Zepto has built a strong revenue model. Here’s how the company earns money:\\\\na. Product Margins\\\\n- Zepto earns revenue through the sale of groceries and daily essentials. The company procures goods directly from manufacturers, wholesalers, and distributors at lower prices, allowing it to enjoy healthy margins on most products.\\\\n- Its dark store model ensures cost efficiency, as these warehouses are located in less expensive real estate areas compared to retail spaces.\\\\nb. Delivery Charges\\\\n- While Zepto offers free delivery for orders above a certain threshold, it charges a delivery fee for smaller orders. This fee helps cover operational and logistics costs.\\\\n- In addition, Zepto has experimented with subscription-based delivery models, offering unlimited free deliveries for a monthly or annual fee.\\\\nc. Advertising and Promotional Listings\\\\n- Zepto monetizes its platform by allowing brands to advertise and promote their products. This includes:\\\\n- Featured listings on the app.\\\\n- Banner advertisements for specific brands or products.\\\\n- These promotions help brands gain visibility and increase sales, while Zepto earns a commission for the space and exposure provided.\\\\nd. Private Label Products\\\\n- Zepto has introduced its private label brands, offering staples like rice, pulses, and cooking oil under its own label. These products yield higher profit margins compared to third-party goods and help build customer loyalty.\\\\ne. Data Monetization\\\\n- By collecting and analyzing customer data, Zepto generates valuable insights on buying patterns, preferences, and demand trends. While this isn’t a direct revenue stream currently, it offers long-term monetization opportunities through partnerships with FMCG brands and suppliers.\\\\nKey Features of Zepto’s Strategy\\\\nZepto’s success can be attributed to its strategic focus on operational efficiency and customer experience. Here are the core elements of its strategy:\\\\na. Technology-Driven Operations\\\\n- Zepto leverages advanced technology, including AI and machine learning, to optimize inventory, manage supply chains, and predict demand.\\\\n- The company’s algorithm ensures that products are stocked in the right quantities and locations, minimizing wastage and ensuring availability.\\\\nb. Strategic Location of Dark Stores\\\\n- Dark stores are located in high-demand areas, ensuring that they can cater to a radius of 1–3 kilometers. This proximity to customers is critical for meeting the 10-minute delivery promise.\\\\nc. Focus on Speed and Convenience\\\\n- Speed is the cornerstone of Zepto’s business model. Orders are processed immediately after being placed, and delivery riders are assigned based on proximity and route optimization.\\\\n- The app’s user-friendly interface adds to the convenience factor, ensuring repeat purchases.\\\\nd. Diverse Product Offering\\\\n- Zepto offers a wide range of products, from fresh produce and groceries to personal care items, snacks, and beverages. This variety ensures that it meets diverse customer needs.\\\\nZepto’s Financial Performance\\\\nZepto has demonstrated impressive growth in a short span of time. As of the latest updates:\\\\n- Revenue Growth: Zepto reported robust revenue growth, driven by an increase in repeat customers and higher order volumes.\\\\n- Burn Rate: Like many startups in the q-commerce space, Zepto operates at a high burn rate due to marketing, operations, and delivery costs. However, the company is focused on achieving profitability by optimizing operations and increasing average order values.\\\\nChallenges Faced by Zepto\\\\nDespite its rapid success, Zepto faces several challenges:\\\\n- High Competition: Players like Blinkit (Zomato-owned), Swiggy Instamart, and Dunzo are fierce competitors in the quick-commerce space, offering similar services.\\\\n- Logistics Costs: Maintaining a fleet of delivery personnel and managing dark store operations require significant investment.\\\\n- Customer Retention: As the novelty of 10-minute delivery wears off, retaining customers with value-added services and competitive pricing becomes crucial.\\\\n- Regulatory Scrutiny: The quick-commerce industry has faced criticism for putting undue pressure on delivery personnel, raising concerns about safety and labor practices.\\\\nFuture Prospects and Growth Strategies\\\\nZepto has ambitious plans for the future, including:\\\\n- Geographical Expansion: The company is expanding its footprint in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, tapping into the growing demand for convenience.\\\\n- New Product Categories: Zepto is exploring new categories like electronics and pharmacy to diversify its offerings.\\\\n- Sustainability Initiatives: The company is working on reducing packaging waste and introducing eco-friendly delivery practices.\\\\n- AI and Automation: Continued investment in technology will help Zepto improve operational efficiency and lower costs.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nZepto’s business model is a testament to the growing demand for quick commerce in urban India. By focusing on speed, technology, and customer convenience, the company has carved out a unique space in the competitive grocery delivery market.

It promises to deliver groceries to your doorsteps within 10 minutes. Other companies offer delivery within 30 minutes. But Zepto delivers the daily essentials within 10 minutes. The business model of Zepto involves its business plan, revenue model, competitors, SWOT Analysis, and many more.\\\\nZepto’s business model was developed by a couple of successful instant grocery delivery startup founders. The company was founded by two teenagers Aadit Palecha and his childhood buddy Kaivalya Vohra. The Zepto business model works within the quick commerce segment in India.\\\\nBusiness Plan\\\\nThe Zepto business model promises to deliver your grocery in 10 minutes. Zepto’s network of “cloud shops” or “micro-warehouses” allows the company to fill orders quickly and efficiently. Zepto business model is based on the “dark store model.” This involves setting up warehouse-style stores in residential areas that are only accessible to delivery drivers. The stores contain a range of products, and customers can only order via the Zepto India app or website. Zepto currently has over 86+ dark stores in various locations. While dark stores are designed for instant deliveries, they can’t always handle high sales volume.\\\\nZepto has places called dark stores or micro fulfillment centers that lie in higher-demand neighborhoods. These dark stores use technology for performing tasks such as the placement of products. Some other tasks they perform include deciding the store locations, and mapping delivery routes for avoiding heavy traffic congestions. The company is already delivering items that include cooking necessities, fresh produce, personal care items, snacks and beverages, and home cleaning items.\\\\n- Faster delivery and enhanced distribution\\\\n- Raise customer reach\\\\n- Contactless shopping\\\\n- Enhanced Product Assortment and Inventory\\\\nThese facilities, which allow the company to fulfill its ten-minute promise on up to 90% of orders, possess the following characteristics:\\\\n- They are not open to the public.\\\\n- They are located in high-demand neighborhoods.\\\\n- They stock only the most commonly ordered items.\\\\n- They are ergonomically designed to ensure order packers can move as swiftly and efficiently as possible.\\\\nRevenue Model\\\\nZepto makes money by charging a commission fee from the grocery stores for every order placed through the app. Additionally, Zepto may charge a delivery fee from the customers for the delivery service.\\\\nMargins on each individual product\\\\nHandling Charges\\\\nProduct Customizations\\\\nProduct Ads\\\\nMembership\\\\nBy subscribing to their membership, you can get\\\\n- Free deliveries on all orders\\\\n- No surge fees\\\\n- Better discounts\\\\nCompetitors\\\\nSWOT Analysis\\\\nStrengths\\\\n• Excellent usage of technology: With the assistance of www.locus.sh Zepto records its customers’ geographical data, traffic dynamics, delivery time, and so on. They gather and evaluate this data to determine whether more dark establishments are needed in the region to meet the 10-minute objective.\\\\n• Competent Workforce: The effective management of Zepto is in the hands of highly skilled and experienced professionals. They are Zepto’ s most valuable resource since they are well informed about the market. Palicha and Vohra, the co-founders, did a fantastic job in creating their team.\\\\n• Strong financial support: Zepto is well-funded, which allows it to expand and grow into a market leader. They currently have a total funding of $360 million.\\\\n• Being true to their objective: Zepto ensures that their customers’ expectations are met by delivering goods in 10 minutes. Zepto achieves their aim 90% of the time, which contributes to brand loyalty.\\\\nWeakness\\\\n• Net Income: Zepto’s operational costs are high. They need to grow their sales while decreasing some of their expenditures to make their business profitable.\\\\n• Reliance on retailers: Zepto’s business strategy is primarily dependent on other businesses and their inventory. When a retailer’s stock is unavailable, customers may be forced to select a higher-priced substitution or go without buying that item from them.\\\\n• Nothing Unique: Zepto’s business strategy is not very unique, and any company may enter this market and replicate it.\\\\n• Fluctuating customer base: To keep their clientele, Zepto must find a balance between their discount strategy and keeping their delivery time under 10 minutes.\\\\nOpportunity\\\\n• Infiltrating further into existing locations and entering fresh cities: One way they can outperform their competitors is to grow their business as quickly as possible.\\\\n• Various Business Ventures: Zepto has developed a brand identity for itself, which they can now utilize to enter into other sectors and diversify their revenue stream.\\\\nThreats\\\\n- Heavy competition: Zepto is in a league with big names. Customers swing from one app to the next like a pendulum. Because there is little consumer loyalty, Zepto must continually stay on top of their game.\\\\n- Exploitation of delivery boys: There are several sceptics of the quick commerce industry. Delivery boys are exploited in the name of quick delivery and are subjected to extreme strain, increasing the likelihood of an accident.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nZepto is a detail-oriented and intense business with strong technical and operating discipline that allows them to pull off the 10-minute delivery. Zepto is looking to offer its service to more countries. This company is planning to cover about 100 pin codes. The fastest delivery is a fresh idea. The delivery platform brings fast delivery to customers through the dark store concept.\\\\n                \\\\n                None\\\\n                \\\\n                International Journal of Advanced Research in Commerce, Management &Social Science (IJARCMSS) 193 \\\\nISSN :2581-7930,  Impact Factor : 6.809, Volume 05, No. 04(II), October-December,  2022, pp 193-196 \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\nJUST IN 10 MINUTES: A CASE STUDY ON ZEPTO \\\\n \\\\n Dr. Sunita Gupta\\\\uf02a \\\\nAvani Pandey** \\\\nABSTRACT \\\\n \\\\nThis case discusses the working of Zepto , an e -commerce company founded in April 2021 in \\\\nBandra, Mumbai by two 19 -year-old Stanford dropouts Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra.  Well, they are \\\\nnot newbies in the start -up world, this is their third start -up after GoPool and Kiranakart.  They came with \\\\nthis ground-breaking idea while sitting in their homes and waiting for their groceries to be delivered in 2 -3 \\\\ndays. Zepto belongs to those start -up subgroups that experienced meteoric development in the post -\\\\nCovid period. This case explains the developme nt process of how the company is making it possible to \\\\ndeliver items in 10 minutes. Zepto has raised $360 million in funding with the lead investors being the \\\\nAmerican start up accelerator company Y Combinator and the American growth equity firm Glade Broo k \\\\nCapital Partners. Currently, the company has a valuation of $900 million. 1 So, the possibility that Zepto  \\\\nwill soon turn into a unicorn is not a daft idea. However, there is a major concern surrounding Zepto’ s \\\\nbusiness model as they have still not made the business profitable. Zepto is also facing tough \\\\ncompetition from its rival Blinkit (formerly known as Grofers) who was founded in December 2013. \\\\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\\\n \\\\nKeywords: Zepto, Start-up, E-commerce, Business Model, Post-Covid. \\\\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\\\n \\\\nIntroduction \\\\n Zepto is a quick e-commerce company that started its operations in 2021. \\\\n The company started its operations in Bandra, Mumbai and has subsequently extended its \\\\ndelivery areas to Pune, Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Ghaziabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata. \\\\n On October 31, 2021, a total of 8 investors, led by Glade Brook Capital Partners, invested in \\\\nthem $60 million after which more investors began to notice them. Later, they raised additional funding \\\\nthrough their series C and series D rounds. Y Combinator Continuity Fund became the major investor in \\\\nboth of these rounds. \\\\n The Series C and D rounds were held on December 20, 2021 and May 2, 2022 and raised $100 \\\\nmillion and $200 million respectively2.But Zepto is not the only quick commerce start-up that is backed by \\\\nstrong funding, it is up against fierce competition in India from Blinkit. Blinkit has received backing from \\\\n24 investor s and has gone through a total of 19 fundraising rounds. Blinkit is currently valued at $1 \\\\nbillion3. And then there is also Dunzo which is backed by Google. \\\\nZepto’ s tagline is \"Groceries delivered in 10 minutes”. They do this with the help of Dark stores . \\\\nThey are nothing but warehouses that are not open to the public and are located in such area in the \\\\nneighbourhood where demand is high.Only commonly requested commodities are kept in these \\\\nwarehouses, preventing the loss of unsold stock. Zepto’ s dark st ores are designed in a way so that \\\\norders are filled as rapidly as possible, effectively and efficiently reducing time. Currently, Zepto is \\\\ndelivering 2500+ goods, including food and drink, personal care products, fresh produce, home cleaning \\\\nsupplies, and  snacks and beverages, from its 100+ dark stores. As stated by the CEO of zepto  Aadit \\\\nPalicha the average delivery time taken by Zepto is 8 minutes and 47 seconds. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf02a Supervisor, Mentor &Associate Professor, Department of Commerce, Daulat Ram College, University of \\\\nDelhi, Delhi, India. \\\\n**  Student pursuing B.

The company uses artificial intelligence (AI) t o \\\\nenhance the effectiveness of its delivery network by taking into account variables like weather, traffic \\\\npatterns, population, geography, and the availability of last-mile supplies. \\\\n The co-founders have managed to make the roots of the company strong by  getting the best \\\\ntalent out there to work for them when they first started building a team.  They were successful in \\\\npersuading a number of high-profile executives from Dream 11, Amazon, Uber, Pharmeasy, and Flipkart. \\\\n(Source: LinkedIn) \\\\nThese qualified exe cutives have assisted Zepto in achieving unit economics and capital \\\\nefficiency. They are what have allowed Zepto to carve out a place for itself in the grocery’s delivery \\\\nmarket. \\\\nFindings  \\\\nGroceries account for the majority of India\\\\\\'s $1 trillion retail market.1 Consequently, this market \\\\nhas enormous potential. During Corona, it was challenging to leave the house every time you wanted to \\\\nbuy a small essential item, and today with people having to work for long hours, especially in urban cities, \\\\nit is challenging to go out and shop for daily groceries. The market needed an app like Zepto more than it \\\\nwanted one, thus its release was ideal. These apps help customers to save their time  and make their life \\\\neasier. As of right now, as mentioned by the C EO of zepto, they receive 100,000 orders each day, and \\\\ntheir demand curve is essentially flat. They once more turn to technology to determine the ideal location \\\\nfor their tiny fulfilment centres. \\\\nAlthough some would believe that Zepto’ s delivery speed is what sets them apart from the \\\\ncompetition, this is not the case. The key element that sets zepto apart from its rivals is not the quickness \\\\nof the delivery men, but rather how effectively it uses technology. Zepto tracks its customers\\\\\\' spatial data, \\\\ntraffic dynamics, the time it takes to deliver the items, etc. with the aid of www.locus.sh. They collect this \\\\ndata and analyse it to decide whether they need more dark stores in the area to be able to achieve that \\\\n10-minute goal. \\\\nZepto Generates Income in Two Ways \\\\n• It first negotiates a profit margin with the companies based on how much of their product is kept \\\\nin the warehouse. \\\\n• Second, they make money by charging companies for ad space and the top search results. \\\\n• Zepto had total revenue of INR 142.3 Cr in FY22, while incurring costs of INR 532.7 Cr. They \\\\nsuffered a loss of 390.3 Cr INR as a result. \\\\nMarketing costs make up the majority of their spending \\\\nThey invest a lot of money in promoting and advertising their app. During FY22, they spent INR \\\\n175.5 Cr, or almo st 33% of their overall expenses on marketing. In addition to this, the firm spent INR \\\\n213.2 Cr on stock -in-trade purchases in FY22. Employee benefits cost INR 50.3 Cr, while supply chain \\\\ncosts were INR 74 Cr.2 \\\\nZepto’ s EBITDA margin in FY22 was -259.39%.3An EBITDA offers a clear picture of the \\\\ncompany\\\\\\'s worth and displays it to potential buyers and investors. Unfortunately, Zepto’ s EBITDA is \\\\nnegative. \\\\n To distribute the products, Zepto utilizes gig workers. These individuals make an average \\\\nincome of INR 1,30,211.4 \\\\n Zepto has been able to outperform the competition because of its business model. They have a \\\\nhighly effective distribution system, and Zepto’ s AI-powered tools make it simple to manage and keep an \\\\neye on inventory and product selection.

While Zepto has suffered losses, it is still in a better situation than Blinkit \\\\nand Dunzo, which have suffered losses of INR 1,019 Cr and INR 464 Cr respectively.1 \\\\nThe quick commerce industry has a customer base that is not very devoted, s o even if delivery \\\\ntime increases by a few minutes, customers will still go where they can obtain the best deals. \\\\n Zepto has to strike a balance between discounts and deals and keep their delivery time between \\\\n10 and 20 minutes. Blinkit is their sole main rival at the moment in this market. They need to start \\\\npenetrating into newer cities if they want to distinctly emerge as the leaders of quick commerce. \\\\nZepto has to diversify its revenue streams and stop relying solely on a limited range of sources. \\\\nAccording to the founders of Zepto, they are planning to open a Zepto café that will provide popular \\\\nbrand’s coffee and tea. If it were to become a reality, it may  be successful since metropolitan city\\\\\\'s youth \\\\nrun on caffeine, and hitting up chaayos or blue tokaievery time you feel like drinking one is impractical. If \\\\nZepto wants to make this business a success, they will need more funding. Since Zepto has already \\\\nestablished a reputation for itself and everything associated with that name would benefit from its \\\\ngoodwill, their marketing costs shouldn\\\\\\'t be too high. \\\\nZepto, as well as any other rapid commerce start -up, solely receives criticism for how it treats \\\\ndelivery guys. Due to the shorter time constraints these workers must adhere to, they may drive rashly, \\\\nincreasing the chances of accidents.  Zepto, however, refutes these criticisms by pointing to their \\\\nadvanced technology, which enables the driver to arrive at the destination both securely and on time. \\\\nSWOT Analysis \\\\nStrengths \\\\n• Excellent usage of technology:  With the assistance of www.locus.sh Zepto records its \\\\ncustomers\\\\\\' geographical data, traffic dynamics, delivery time, and so on. They gather and \\\\nevaluate this data to determine whether more dark establishments are needed in the region to \\\\nmeet the 10-minute objective. \\\\n• Being true to their objective:  Zepto ensures that their customers\\\\\\' expectations are met by \\\\ndelivering goods in 10 minutes. Zepto achieves their ai m 90% of the time, which contributes to \\\\nbrand loyalty. \\\\n• Strong financial support:  Zepto is well -funded, which allows it to expand and grow into a \\\\nmarket leader. They currently have a total funding of $360 million. \\\\n• Competent Workforce: The effective management of Zepto is in the hands of highly skilled and \\\\nexperienced professionals. They are Zepto’ s most valuable resource since they are well -\\\\ninformed about the market. Palicha and Vohra, the co -founders, did a fantastic job in creating \\\\ntheir team. \\\\nWeakness \\\\n• Reliance on retailers: Zepto’s business strategy is primarily dependent on other businesses \\\\nand their inventory. When a retailer\\\\\\'s stock is unavailable, customers may be forced to select a \\\\nhigher-priced substitution or go without buying that item from them. \\\\n• Fluctuating customer base:  To keep their clientele, Zepto must find a balance between their \\\\ndiscount strategy and keeping their delivery time under 10 minutes. \\\\n• Net Income: Zepto’s operational costs are high. They need to grow their sales while decreasing  \\\\nsome of their expenditures to make their business profitable. \\\\n• Nothing Unique: Zepto’s business strategy is not very unique, and any company may enter this \\\\nmarket and replicate it. \\\\n \\\\n1  https://www.vccircle.com/blinkits-marketplace-arm-s-fy22-loss-widens-to-over-rs-1-000-\\\\ncrore#:~:text=Blinkit\\\\\\'s%20marketplace%20arm\\\\\\'s%20FY22%20loss%20widens%20to%20over%20Rs%201%2C000%20crore, -\\\\nBy%20Malvika%20Maloo&text=Zomato%2Downed%20Blinkit\\\\\\'s%20marketplace%20arm,on%20transportation%2C%20contract%\\\\n20and%20advertising. \\\\nhttps://inc42.com/buzz/dunzos-loss-widens-2x-to-inr-464-cr-in-fy22-as-expenses-also-double/#:~:text=Share%20story-\\\\n,Dunzo\\\\\\'s%20Loss%20Widens%202X%20To%20INR%20464,FY22%20As%20E xpenses%20Also%20Double&text=Bengaluru%2\\\\nDbased%20hyperlocal%20delivery%20platform,due%20to%20doubling%20of%20expenses . \\\\n \\\\x0c196 International Journal of Advanced Research in Commerce, Management & Social Science (IJARCMSS)  -October-December, 2022 \\\\nOpportunity \\\\n• Infiltrating further into existing locations and entering fresh  cities: One way they can \\\\noutperform their competitors is to grow their business as quickly as possible. \\\\n• Various Business Ventures:  Zepto has developed a brand identity for itself, which they can \\\\nnow utilize to enter into other sectors and diversify their revenue stream. \\\\nThreats \\\\nHeavy competition: Zepto is in a league with big names. Customers swing from one app to the \\\\nnext like a pendulum. Because there is little consumer loyalty, Zepto must continually stay on top of their \\\\ngame. \\\\n Exploitation of delivery boys: There are several sceptics of the quick commerce industry. \\\\nDelivery boys are exploited in the name of quick delivery and are subjected to extreme strain, increasing \\\\nthe likelihood of an accident. \\\\nConclusion  \\\\nSince its start in April 2021, Zepto has grown organically to become one of India\\\\\\'s most valuable \\\\nand promising start -ups. Zepto has everything a successful firm requires: a talented and dedicated \\\\nworkforce, solid funding, and the use of technology to operate rapidly. However, they cannot handle huge \\\\nsales volume since the dark stores they utilise for speedy delivery are not built to support large scale \\\\noperations. They  keep a limited number of fresh items in hand because if they are not sold, they will \\\\nsuffer losses as the items stale. As a result , there is a possibility that the consumer use competitor\\\\\\'s app \\\\nsince the things they want are out of stock. \\\\nOn the face of it, if Blinkit exists& grows, it is difficult for Zepto  to be the market leader. Both \\\\nhave a nearly identical business model, and Bl inkit’ s delivery time is also less than 10 minutes so \\\\nactually they both don’t have anything unique that sets them apart. The only thing that can help Zepto to \\\\ncompete with Blinkit and become a stable business firm is expanding into more cities and having  a wider \\\\nrange of products to pick from. \\\\nZepto along with other apps is effectively breaking the mould of traditional purchasing and \\\\nestablishing an e-consumerism habit. There is no doubt that Zepto is now expanding faster than anybody \\\\nelse in this sector. They are detail-oriented and employ AI-based technologies well. \\\\nZepto is expected to become a unicorn in 2023. 1However, being a unicorn does not imply that \\\\nthe firm is profitable. \\\\nIn the FY22 their revenue was considerable, as seen by the number of orders they received \\\\neach day, but their operational costs were high and  hence they suffered losses. If they want to become a \\\\nprofitable firm, they must expand into newer cities while adhering to their basic principles and finding \\\\nmethods to reduce their operational expenses. \\\\nReferences  \\\\n1. https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto/news \\\\n2. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto \\\\n3. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zepto-29b1 \\\\n4. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/grofers-trusted-delivery-partner \\\\n5.

Founded by two Stanford dropouts, Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, Zepto\\\\\\'s journey is a remarkable tale of innovation, perseverance, and rapid growth.\\\\nThe Genesis of Zepto\\\\nAadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, driven by their entrepreneurial spirit and a keen understanding of consumer needs, launched Zepto in 2021. Initially, the duo started a logistics company called Kiranakart, aiming to solve the last-mile delivery problem. However, they soon realized a significant gap in the market for quick commerce—delivering groceries and essentials within minutes. Pivoting from Kiranakart, they rebranded and launched Zepto, focusing on ultra-fast delivery services.\\\\nThe 19-year-old college dropouts sparked with the idea of Zepto during the COVID-19 lockdowns, when the duo, confined to their homes, faced the frustration of sluggish grocery deliveries. Fueled by a desire to bridge this gap, they ditched their Stanford computer science dreams and dove headfirst into entrepreneurship.\\\\nRapid Growth and Market Penetration\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s promise of delivering groceries within 10 minutes struck a chord with urban consumers, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic when the demand for home delivery services soared. Leveraging dark stores—small warehouses strategically located in high-demand areas—Zepto optimized its logistics and inventory management to ensure swift deliveries.\\\\nThe company\\\\\\'s growth has been nothing short of meteoric. Within a year of its launch, Zepto expanded its operations to major cities across India, including Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, and Hyderabad. Its user base grew exponentially, driven by the convenience and reliability of its services.\\\\nFunding Milestones and Financial Backing\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s innovative approach and robust business model attracted significant investor interest. The company has raised substantial funds in multiple rounds of financing. Notable investors include Y Combinator, Nexus Venture Partners, and Glade Brook Capital. As of its latest funding round, Zepto secured over USD 200 million, valuing the company at approximately USD 900 million.\\\\nThis influx of capital has enabled Zepto to scale its operations, invest in technology, and enhance its infrastructure. The funds are also being utilized to expand its geographic footprint and diversify its product offerings.\\\\nCurrent Situation and Market Position\\\\nToday, Zepto stands as one of the leading quick commerce companies in India. It operates over 100 dark stores across various cities, serving millions of customers. The company’s efficient delivery network and user-friendly app have made it a preferred choice for urban dwellers seeking quick and hassle-free grocery shopping experiences.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s competitive pricing, coupled with frequent discounts and offers, has helped it build a loyal customer base. Moreover, the company’s focus on quality and freshness ensures that consumers receive the best products within the shortest possible time.\\\\nFuture Plans and Strategic Vision\\\\nLooking ahead, Zepto aims to further solidify its market position and continue its growth trajectory. The company plans to expand its operations to more cities and towns across India, tapping into the vast potential of the country\\\\\\'s e-commerce market. Additionally, Zepto is exploring the integration of advanced technologies such as AI and machine learning to enhance its supply chain efficiency and customer experience.\\\\nInternational expansion is also on the horizon. Zepto envisions entering other emerging markets with similar urban demographics and delivery challenges. By replicating its successful model in new regions, the company aims to become a global leader in quick commerce.\\\\nFurthermore, Zepto is committed to sustainability. The company is exploring eco-friendly packaging options and implementing green practices in its operations to reduce its carbon footprint.\\\\nThe Minds Behind Zepto: Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra\\\\nAadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, the dynamic founders of Zepto, share a common vision of revolutionizing urban retail. Both in their early twenties, these young entrepreneurs have demonstrated exceptional business acumen and a deep understanding of technological solutions.\\\\nPalicha, who serves as the CEO, oversees the company\\\\\\'s strategic direction and growth initiatives. Vohra, the CTO, spearheads the technological innovations that drive Zepto\\\\\\'s operations. Their complementary skills and shared passion for problem-solving have been instrumental in Zepto\\\\\\'s success.\\\\nDespite the challenges of dropping out of Stanford and venturing into the highly competitive startup ecosystem, Palicha and Vohra have shown resilience and determination. Their leadership and vision continue to inspire Zepto\\\\\\'s team and stakeholders.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s journey from a nascent startup to a leading quick commerce platform is a testament to the power of innovation and execution. With its strong market presence, substantial funding, and ambitious plans, Zepto is well on its way to redefining how consumers shop for their daily needs. As the company continues to grow and evolve, it promises to remain at the forefront of the quick commerce revolution, delivering convenience and efficiency to millions of consumers.\\\\n                \\\\n                In today’s rapidly evolving tech landscape, Zepto has emerged as a transformative force, revolutionizing the industry with their groundbreaking microchip solutions.

The main drivers of the expansion of online grocery in these markets have been shifting consumer behaviour and customers are becoming more acclimated to online purchasing. As a result, the market for grocery delivery is considered to be quite hopeful.\\\\nSimilar to this, the Indian grocery delivery business, which had a valuation of USD 2.9 billion in 2020, is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 37.1 per cent from 2021 to 2028. But there are already companies like Swiggy, Instamart, Blinkit, BigBasket, and Amazon Fresh. Is there room for a new company to start up?\\\\nYes! An aggregator is not only flourishing; it is also upending the supermarket delivery business. Indeed, the subject at hand is Zepto.\\\\nZepto is simply the fastest-growing business and the grocery delivery service. Zepto promises to bring groceries in under 10 minutes to your door. But how does the incredibly quick delivery work? Unlike other grocery delivery services, which often take 30 minutes. The heart of Zepto is included in this blog. Continue reading to the end to learn more.\\\\nAbout Zepto\\\\nA startup in Mumbai named Zepto provides a 10-minute grocery delivery service. Zepto is a startup founded by Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra that specialises in quick grocery delivery business.\\\\nZepto is praised for being an expert at delivering food before the new year. In 2021, it produced more than one million deliveries while collaborating with 86+ owners of dark stores in thirteen different locations. Zepto uses its network of “cloud shops” or “micro-warehouses” to fill orders quickly.\\\\nZepto’s key to success is its ability to regularly manufacture over 2,500 items for delivery in less than ten minutes. Everything the company does is centred around that, which is how they’ve been able to expand so swiftly while keeping amazing client loyalty.\\\\nThe Parel-based speedy grocery delivery business has reduced the time it takes to deliver groceries to only 10 minutes, thanks to the dark store concept. Rapid commerce is reportedly the next big opportunity the grocery delivery industry wants to seize. Among the fastest-growing businesses in the faster-delivery industry are startups like Zepto in India and Fridge No More in New York City.\\\\nZepto – Industry\\\\nZepto: Industry The $1 trillion retail industry in India, where groceries account for the great majority of consumer expenditure, is helping e-grocery delivery gain pace. The Indian e-grocery market was estimated to be worth $2.9 billion in 2020, and from 2021 to 2028, it is anticipated to increase at a rate of 37.1 per cent.\\\\nDue to changing consumer preferences, increasing urbanisation, and a tech-savvy population that prefers to make purchases online, the industry has seen an increase in prominence over the past few months.\\\\nAccording to a RedSeer report, the fast commerce market will be worth $30 million by 2021. The same market was expected to rise by 15X to $5 billion in 2025.\\\\nConsumers increasingly use specialised and practical internet platforms for food shopping instead of going to their neighbourhood stores as their standard of living rises, and their daily schedules become busier.\\\\nThe appeal of internet grocery delivery business was more apparent after the COVID-19 outbreak. Due to social distance restrictions, consumers are switching to online food shopping because it is not only practical but also secure.\\\\nZepto – Founders and Team\\\\nAadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, two childhood friends who are both 19 years old, founded Zepto after leaving Stanford University’s esteemed computer science department to go back to their native India and launch a business. The business started operating in April of this year after being created in September of the previous year.\\\\nAadit Palicha\\\\nThe CEO and Co-Founder of both Zepto and KiranaKart is Aadit Palicha. Palicha completed a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Stanford University after earning an IB diploma in Mathematics and Computer Science from GEMS Education. Following the completion of Y Combinator Grade: W21, Aadit began working as a Project Lead for PryvaSee. Then, at the age of 17, Aadit Palicha launched GoPool, his first firm. In April 2020, he quit the company and started KiranaKart and Zepto.\\\\nKaivalya Vohra\\\\nKaivalya Vohra is a co-founder and chief technology officer of both Zepto and KiranaKart. He attended Y Combinator with Aadit and has a computer science degree from Stanford University.\\\\nThe number of employees at Zepto ranges from 51 to 200.\\\\nZepto – Startup Story\\\\nEven those of us who are the most creative struggle to see through our “startup ideas,” which are many. Palicha and Vohra had both enrolled at Stanford to pursue degrees in computer science but had left to pursue their interests in entrepreneurship.\\\\nZepto was born out of the constraints of their homes during the Covid-19 outbreak. Groceries and other necessities would arrive in a few days due to increased demand for delivery services, leaving a gap for speedy delivery. Zepto was then developed using all of this knowledge.\\\\nThese youngsters worked together on numerous initiatives, including a ride-hailing app for children, before being abruptly imprisoned in their Mumbai homes due to Covid restrictions. As the virus spread across the country, grocery delivery business—which local authorities still considered to be important—was still allowed in many areas. Still, the two struggled to receive their supplies as the epidemic grew.\\\\nZepto is getting all the limelight, but Palicha and Vohra’s initial business, KiranaKart, did not get the same attention. On the other hand, Zepto draws inspiration from KiranaKart. KiranaKart was a grocery delivery business, as its name suggests. With Kirana traders, it has made arrangements to deliver groceries in 45 minutes or less. Global Founders Capital, 2 AM Ventures, Contrary Capital, and angel investors led a $730,000 pre-seed investment. At the time, Vohra and Palicha intended to charge Rs 1 for the initial 1.5 lakh delivery.\\\\nZepto Business Model: Dark Store model\\\\nDark storefronts may appear ominous, but they undercut one of the many clever strategies that have kept some retail establishments afloat during the pandemic. Dark stores are distribution centres that aren’t accessible to the public. These small warehouses efficiently and precisely fill orders, giving customers access to resources and choices, including online shopping, same-day delivery, and in-store pickup.\\\\nThe founders said that the dark store model’s brilliance is how quickly they pick, pack, and ship merchandise. The last mile is similar to every other delivery strategy, though.\\\\nA similar methodology has been used in Western countries, but it has never been investigated in the Indian setting. The “dark store model” eliminates the minor issues that any delivery service experiences, such as traffic jams, connectivity, and navigation. According to Zepto, the network’s performance has improved due to the use of location intelligence, geography, population, road patterns, traffic dynamics, weather, last-mile supply availability, real estate values, and other factors. Additionally, it currently operates over 40 dark stores across several locales.\\\\nDark stores, however, can’t handle high sales volumes because they’re designed for rapid deliveries. Zepto, however, refused to make allowances for this model’s flaws. They have nearly a thousand items on display, including the finest deals on fresh vegetables, milk, meat, and kitchen supplies. Additionally, their AI-powered technologies guarantee a seamless changeover between selecting, packing, and shipping.\\\\nBenefits of Zepto Business Model\\\\n-\\\\nImproved Distribution and faster delivery\\\\nZepto can fulfil orders more swiftly and effectively thanks to the dark store. Micro and cold warehouses offer various distribution options, which also physically deliver groceries closer to a particular market group. Zepto can better regulate the distribution and market spread thanks to this.\\\\n-\\\\nBroader Customer Reach\\\\nThe dark stores make distribution hubs more accessible to customers, and they accept orders 24/7 online. Customers are drawn to these platforms and employ their services as a result.\\\\n-\\\\nContactless Shopping\\\\nThe need for contact-free shopping has primarily influenced businesses’ adoption of the “dark store” strategy. Dark stores enable customers to buy food without interacting with other people or going into a physical store. They put things online and have them delivered right away.\\\\n-\\\\nImproved Inventory Control and Better Product Assortment\\\\nDark stores have no customers, greater inventory control, and can handle higher order quantities. Packers can move as swiftly as possible to pack the things in an order thanks to the dark stores’ convenient navigation. Additionally, Zepto’s AI-powered solutions maintain product assortment and inventory stock tracking.\\\\nZepto’s USPs\\\\nZepto’s business strategy is absolutely focused on providing quick service to customers. Zepto, however, also offers several selling factors that distinguish it from its rivals. Nevertheless, the model also takes these into account.\\\\nZepto is known for its rapid commerce and instant delivery. It claims to have a median delivery time of 8 minutes, 47 seconds and completes grocery deliveries in under 10 minutes.\\\\nAccording to the founders, by the time a user verifies his order, it has already been dispatched for delivery. Additionally, practically all orders are completed in less than 10 minutes, although 1% of them may require 15–16 minutes or even longer.\\\\nZepto offers free shipping. Although this USP pales compared to the first, there are no delivery fees. At the same time, other companies like Instacart, Amazon Fresh, and others charge a delivery fee.\\\\nFree service does not imply more expensive goods. It offers some attractive discounts on the mentioned goods and foods, which is still another USP.\\\\nZepto – Future Plans\\\\nThe Mumbai-based company will use the money to expand its clientele, hire more staff, and open more dark stores in new cities. Bengaluru and the Delhi-National Capital Region have it already, and Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, and Kolkata will get it within the next 30 days.\\\\nIt plans to open 100 dark enterprises by the end of the year, covering about 100 pin codes. By the end of this year, quick commerce is expected to reach $300 million, and by the year 2025, it will grow to $5 billion.\\\\nNo one in India has fully grasped marketing, according to co-founder Palicha. He continued by saying that when you look at a few older organisations who are trying to follow this strategy, you’ll discover that many of them lack the consistency to run on a single model and are unfocused. They engage in various activities, which is the biggest problem in every major company.\\\\n“We have seen our median delivery times stabilise if not decrease, mainly because as we scale our coverage and our expansion, it ends up being a factor of individual cloud stores and how they perform,” he said.\\\\nExpress delivery is not a fresh idea; the majority of current e-grocers have tried it in the past, with varying degrees of success. These platforms have been bringing back quick delivery to customers, especially via the dark-store concept, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic’s quicker acceptance of online groceries.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nZepto has secured $100 million in Series C funding, valued at $570 million, led by Y Combinator’s Continuity Fund. The founders say that investments in Zepto will help it reach more customers and provide them with better service. As of now, Zepto operates in the Indian metros. However, it has not revealed its consumer count, but sources say Zepto is growing at 200% every month.\\\\nAs we mentioned earlier, the 10 min grocery delivery service has disrupted the grocery delivery space. When it became clear that it couldn’t deliver groceries in under 10 minutes, Blinkit (December 2021) announced a temporary suspension of its operation in those locations. While the market leader Swiggy announced a $700 million investment in its grocery delivery business, Swiggy Instamart, and plans to complete deliveries in 15 minutes by January 2022. By the end of Q2 in FY22, Fraazo, a grocery delivery business with headquarters in Mumbai, plans to triple the number of its dark stores to 750. Dunzo and BigBasket are vying to enter the quick-commerce market.\\\\nReturning to Zepto, it takes a mix of a laser-like focus, swift action, and a resilient team. Additionally, it entered the supermarket delivery area at an excellent time.\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto Business Model | How Zepto Makes Money\\\\n🔍InsightsThe convenience of Internet food delivery services was greatly enhanced during the pandemic. The dominant player in the online grocery delivery app and company market is influencing users\\\\\\' habits.\\\\nOnline shopping is becoming increasingly common among consumers. As a result, more and more delivery services, like Zepto, have launched their services to meet the ever-increasing demands of their clients for lightning-fast delivery. You should be familiar with the Zepto business model if you are looking to enter the market.\\\\nThe supermarket delivery industry is booming, thank goodness, because it requires less time, effort, and money than other industries. In 2020, the projected value of the online grocery business was $2.9 billion. Through this article, we will go over the basics of Zepto, including its business model and how it generates revenue.\\\\nAbout Zepto\\\\nZepto, founded in 2021 by Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, two former Stanford University students, is a platform for quick commerce that provides a grocery delivery service within 10 minutes. Fast grocery delivery was the driving force for the founding of the firm. Zepto boasts delivery to major cities like Bengaluru, Lucknow, Delhi, Chennai, etc., from its Mumbai headquarters. The original company, Kiranakart Technologies Private Limited, was turned off into Zepto by its founders.\\\\nZepto Business Model\\\\nThe \"dark store model\" serves as the foundation for Zepto\\\\\\'s business model. This involves setting up delivery-only warehouse-style stores in residential regions. The shops sell a variety of products, and the sole way for buyers to place orders is through the Zepto India website or app. Across multiple regions, Zepto now has more than eighty-six dark storefronts. Dark businesses are great for quick shipping, but they may crash under heavy traffic. However, Zepto created an AI-driven system to assist with selecting, packing, and shipping to avoid sacrificing quality or service. Zepto can provide an extensive product line at rock-bottom prices because of this technology, which guarantees a seamless transition from choosing to packaging to delivery.\\\\nZepto India can provide a fast delivery service thanks to the convenience of having outlets close to customers\\\\\\' homes, which is an advantage of the Zepto business model. The elimination of the necessity for employees to utilize the store also allows the company to run with a reduced headcount.\\\\nHow Zepto Makes Money | Zepto Revenue Model\\\\nA little commission is charged for each order placed using the Zepto Grocery app in India. Helping to pay the costs of running the app and ensuring that consumers have a great experience, this commission is usually 2-3% of the total order amount.\\\\nWith almost $1.3 billion raised across eight rounds, Zepto is certainly a no-money lightweight, making it the first unicorn startup of 2023.\\\\nIn recent times, the Zepto business model has experienced tremendous expansion. Their incomes increased by 800% while their burn rate per order reduced by 5%. The reason for this rise is that Zepto boasts a 50% growth rate per month.\\\\nHere’s an easy-to-understand version of Zepto’s revenue model:\\\\n- Sales of Products: Zepto makes money by selling groceries, home goods, and personal care items on its website. They buy products from local suppliers and brands, keeping prices low. Sometimes, they charge a little more for certain items compared to regular stores, which helps boost revenue.\\\\n- Delivery Charges: Zepto charges a delivery fee based on factors like how far the delivery is, the order size, or any special deals. This fee helps cover the cost of fast delivery and brings in extra money.\\\\n- Subscription Models: Zepto offers membership plans for regular customers, giving benefits like free delivery or special discounts.

With this, Zepto has become the first unicorn of 2023 in India. This round was led by StepStone Group and Goodwater Capital, with participation from existing investors Nexus Venture Partners and GladeBrook Capital.\\\\nThe funding will be used to expand Zepto’s operations across India and to develop new products and services. Zepto is seen as one of the few players in the market that has the potential to be successful.\\\\nZepto business model was developed by a couple of successful instant grocery delivery startup founders. The company was founded by two teenagers Aadit Palecha and his childhood buddy Kaivalya Vohra who were both 19 at the time. The Zepto business model works within the quick commerce segment in India.\\\\nBoth the Zepto founders were studying computer science at Stanford University and left the course to enter quick commerce in India. The Zepto business model promises to deliver your grocery in 10 minutes.\\\\nThe company began its operations in Mumbai in 2021 and has since extended its operations.\\\\nThe arrival of Zepto in India\\\\nEven the arrival of the startup in India was a bit serendipitous. Both Kaivalya Vohra and Aadit Palicha had returned to the country for a break just before the coronavirus pandemic engulfed India. Both these teenagers had partnered on several other projects earlier. They created a ride-hailing commute app suitable for school-going kids. But this time they found themselves locked in their homes when they arrived in Mumbai.\\\\nWith the pandemic raging on mercilessly, both the teenagers were struggling to get their grocery supplies. This was even though grocery deliveries were categorized as essential by the government. They felt the need for having an online player for the grocery delivery sector in India. Despite being one of the largest markets in the world they were still grappling with some execution errors.\\\\nAlso Read\\\\n“I was told service class people cannot afford to start a business”\\\\nHow Zepto works\\\\nZepto has places called dark stores or micro fulfillment centers that lie in higher-demand neighborhoods. These dark stores use technology for performing tasks such as the placement of products. Some other tasks they perform include deciding the store locations, and mapping delivery routes for avoiding heavy traffic congestions. The company is already delivering items that include cooking necessities, fresh produce, personal care items, snacks and beverages, and home cleaning items.\\\\nAlso Read\\\\n“Best-selling on Zomato, still I want my own online platform”\\\\nAcquiring talent\\\\nOne of the main things that went in the right direction for the startup was the talent acquisition department. They were able to attract several top-profile executives from Amazon Uber, Pharmeasy, Flipkart, and Dream 11 to join their organization.\\\\nThe main thing that led to so many top executives deciding to join Zepto was that it allowed several people that moved to Bangalore to come back to Mumbai. However, the aggressive growth of the startup, its ambition, and its disciplined execution have led to several people that are similarly inclined to be attracted to the company.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nSeveral other players are trying to participate in the market and trying to grow quickly. But they cannot promise things such as 10-minute delivery as consistently as Zepto. This period extends to 30, 40, and 45 minutes in most cases. Zepto is a detail-oriented and intense business with strong technical and operating discipline that allows them to pull off the 10-minute delivery.\\\\nBuild your own app like Zepto\\\\nIf you are looking to set up an on-demand business one of the best places to visit for a technology-based solution will be Jungleworks.

Offering a diverse range of high-quality products, including groceries, fresh produce, household items, and personal care products, Zepto ensures customer satisfaction and encourages repeat business.

This integrated approach demonstrates Zepto\\\\\\'s dedication to providing convenience and efficiency in the grocery delivery industry. Zepto\\\\\\'s business strategy revolves around offering ultra-fast delivery, with a focus on customer convenience and satisfaction.\\\\nPromotion\\\\nZepto employs a diverse marketing approach, utilizing digital channels like social media and influencer marketing, alongside out-of-home advertising for brand visibility.

Zepto focuses on city areas, offering a simple online shopping experience.\\\\nZepto Marketing Strategy\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s marketing strategy has played a crucial role in growing its business to this extent. A lot of innovative steps have been taken by the company to support and boost its business growth. Zepto\\\\\\'s target audience is generally young adults and the modern generation. Here is the detailed overview you must read.\\\\n10-Mins Delivery Strategy\\\\nThe idea of online grocery delivery is not new. Startups like Dunzo and Blinkit are already providing these services. The fact that distinguishes Zepto from all its competitors is its 10-minute delivery of groceries and other products. You might have heard about Zomato Instant, which provides food delivery within 10 minutes, but Zepto is the first player in the grocery delivery segment to offer a 10-minute grocery delivery service.\\\\nThe idea of 10-minute grocery delivery is unique, but it was not that easy to implement. To fulfill its promise to deliver groceries in the specified time, Zepto introduced the concept of the dark store model. The dark store is like a fulfillment center for Zepto; it is not accessible to the public but is efficient enough to fulfill orders rapidly.\\\\nArtificial intelligence is used by Zepto to pick, pack, and transport orders in leaps and bounds. Whenever any customer places an order, a person with a tablet is assigned to pick up and pack the order within 60 seconds. It means that at the time you make the payment, someone is already preparing your order for dispatch. The company claims that 8 minutes and 40 seconds is the average delivery time they have achieved.\\\\nZepto operates its dark store delivery within a 3 km radius, and it doesn\\\\\\'t penalize its delivery boy for late delivery.\\\\nDiscounts are a way to attract customers, but as a new player in the segment, offering huge discounts was not a sustainable option for Zepto. Hence, the 10-minute delivery strategy comes out to be a panacea for Zepto.\\\\nAdvertising and Branding Strategy\\\\nThere is not only one thing responsible for the success of Zepto, but an incredible advertising strategy has also played an important role in the success. L&K Saatchi and Saatchi is an advertising agency that was assigned to advertise Zepto and build a strong brand image in front of consumers. The main theme of all the ads is to emphasize the 10-minute delivery of Zepto.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s ads are attention-grabbing ads that suddenly capture the focus, and this is what every brand wants. When a boy suddenly wakes up and runs toward the door, it creates a question in the minds of viewers about why he is running. The twist and excitement of the ad make it capable of grabbing the attention of viewers.\\\\nIf I try to summarize the above ad in a single sentence, then it is like this: From the time you wake up until the time you sleep, every essential product will get delivered to your doorstep within 10 minutes.\\\\nEach ad that was created is meant to make the consumer feel how Zepto is capable of changing their daily grocery shopping habit. Since advertising is the best way to market the product and build a strong brand image, Zepto has fully utilized the benefits of marketing.\\\\nAdvertising was not only done on social media channels, but it also planted its hoardings in the streets of cities in which Zepto\\\\\\'s services are operational.\\\\nSocial Media Meme Marketing\\\\nIn today\\\\\\'s generation of technology and innovation, we cannot ignore the power of social media. There is a huge chance you\\\\\\'ll find your target audience on the social media platform. Hence, every brand is focusing on social media marketing. Zepto is also not behind the race; it leverages the social platform to engage its audience through meme marketing.\\\\nFor the recently released movie \\\\\\'Avatar: The Way of Water,\\\\\\' Zepto created a meme to grab the consumer\\\\\\'s attention by following the ongoing trend. It\\\\\\'s just one example, but if you visit Zepto\\\\\\'s social media page, you\\\\\\'ll find plenty of such memes.\\\\nMeme marketing is a trend today because people often share memes with their loved ones. This will help the brand get some organic reach and, at the same time, promote the brand. Zepto knows the power of memes very well. That\\\\\\'s why if you open their page on any platform like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, you\\\\\\'ll find amazing memes.\\\\nTh has gained a lot of positive feedback from customers. Along with meme marketing, they sometimes collaborate with famous social media influencers to make videos for them. This tactic helps to create a loyal fanbase and also helps the brand image flourish.\\\\nMicro-Moments Marketing Strategy\\\\nMicro-moments are key moments in a customer\\\\\\'s journey where brands can influence buying decisions. Zepto understands this and focuses on sending the right messages at the right time to connect with customers. Studies show that over 150 billion mobile micro-moments happen every day, influencing more than 70% of purchases. Brands using this approach see a 74% success rate in increasing revenue.\\\\nCustomer Acquisition and Retention Strategy\\\\nPlayers in the quick commerce industry like Dunzo, Swiggy Instamart, and Blinkit are well-funded and established. These big giants have already acquired a huge market share in the segment by offering huge discounts and other offers. So it was not easy for Zepto to acquire customers and retain them.\\\\nDiscounts are not the only things that attract consumers. Consumers are always hungry for something new, and exactly here, Zepto played its game. Acquisition of customers and retaining customers are two different things. Other players in the segment have easily acquired customers but struggled to retain them.\\\\nCustomers are used to switching platforms and ordering items from the app, where the discount is heavy. In the case of Zepto, it has given discounts and at the same time provided high-speed free delivery. It helps to enhance Zepto\\\\\\'s retention rate significantly.\\\\nNo other players in the segment were making that fast delivery. This eventually leads to an increase in Zepto\\\\\\'s consumer base.\\\\nDigital Marketing\\\\nZepto uses digital marketing to reach busy customers with fast and targeted ads. They focus on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook to promote quick delivery and special offers. Zepto also uses precision messaging or micro-moments to engage customers when they are likely to make a purchase. Through online campaigns, Zepto builds brand awareness and encourages customers to use their service for fast grocery deliveries.\\\\nReferral Programs\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s referral program plays a crucial role in its successful marketing strategy. The program offers unique codes to its users for sharing, which incentivizes both existing and new users with rewards such as discounts. This helps in cost-effective customer acquisition and increases customer retention. The program\\\\\\'s seamless integration with social media, multiple reward options, and gamification elements make it a dynamic and impactful tool for Zepto\\\\\\'s growth and customer loyalty.\\\\nBeyond transactional benefits, Zepto\\\\\\'s referral initiative is a brand-building powerhouse, fostering advocacy and community engagement. By creating a positive customer experience and utilizing word-of-mouth influence, the program stands as a testament to the brand\\\\\\'s commitment to customer satisfaction and strategic marketing prowess.\\\\nPartnerships with Influencers\\\\nZepto partners with social media influencers who create authentic content to showcase its services. This helps Zepto build trust, connect with specific audiences, and reach more customers. This approach has fueled rapid growth, with the company raising over $300 million in just one year, emphasizing its focus on long-term customer relationships.\\\\nMarketing Campaign of Zepto\\\\nboAt, India’s leading audio brand, has teamed up with Zepto to bring high-quality audio products to your doorstep in just 10 minutes. This partnership combines boAt’s top-notch audio expertise with Zepto’s quick delivery, making it easier to enjoy music, movies, podcasts, and more. Whether it\\\\\\'s a party, a podcast, or binge-watching, boAt and Zepto ensure the perfect audio experience is just a tap away.\\\\nA marketing campaign is an integral part of any brand\\\\\\'s effort to increase its visibility and create brand awareness. The same is true for Zepto. In the IPL 2022, Zepto created and ran a marketing campaign that truly had a new approach.\\\\nMost of the time, we have faced the issue of time stretching in different places like airports, hospitals, and restaurants. Because we usually wait for a long time in these places, it became quite common for us, but Zepto addressed this issue and showcased it in its campaign in such a way that, at the same time, it also represented the 10-minute delivery promise of Zepto.\\\\nIn this campaign, three famous singers—Shankar Mahadevan, Usha Uthup, and Kailash Kher—have given their incredible voices. Three ads have been created for this campaign with the voices of these three singers. They have stretched the time with their voices in such a way that it shows our habit of waiting. At the same time, Zepto implements its tagline of 10-minute delivery.\\\\nL&K Saatchi and Saatchi created this campaign very beautifully, and the whole marketing campaign turned out to be a huge success for Zepto.\\\\nIn this brand campaign, Zepto has come up with a significant collaboration featuring renowned cricketer Jasprit Bumrah as the brand ambassador. Developed by L&K Saatchi & Saatchi, the \\\\\\'Groceries delivered at Bumrah Speed\\\\\\' campaign embodies speed, precision, consistency, and rigor. This initiative not only introduces Indian audiences to cutting-edge special effects but also promises an experience comparable to the grandeur of cinema.\\\\nThe campaign\\\\\\'s focal point will be on Disney+ Hotstar, other leading OTT platforms, Zepto\\\\\\'s application, social media channels, and various digital platforms. Outdoor advertising will be prominently displayed across major cities where Zepto operates, ensuring widespread visibility and engagement.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s \\\\\\'Nahi Milega\\\\\\' brand campaign underscores its commitment, emphasizing that while life may present unattainable challenges, unlimited free deliveries on Zepto are certain.\\\\nZepto adopted an unconventional approach by introducing Uncle Ji, a character from Delhi, several weeks before unveiling their brand campaign. The intention was to disrupt social media with Uncle Ji\\\\\\'s distinctive personality, straightforward expressions of reality, and the recurring catchphrase \\\\\\'Nahi Milega\\\\\\' (won\\\\\\'t be available).\\\\nZepto said Uncle Ji\\\\\\'s character achieved remarkable organic traction, accumulating 10 million impressions with a substantial 10% engagement rate across all social media platforms. Uncle Ji trended at #6 on Twitter and received endorsements from popular Twitter celebrities and Instagram meme pages, solidifying his status as a cultural icon in India.\\\\nZepto USP\\\\nZepto’s business model focuses on customers and offers instant delivery, setting it apart from competitors. The app is known for being the fastest, delivering groceries in as little as 10 minutes, with a claimed average time of 8 minutes and 47 seconds. When users place an order, it\\\\\\'s already on its way. Zepto also offers free shipping, unlike Amazon Fresh and Instacart, which charge delivery fees. Despite offering free delivery, Zepto doesn\\\\\\'t raise product prices and provides great discounts on groceries.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nZepto is a young startup, and it has achieved this success in a short period of time because of its incredible marketing strategy.

Therefore, how can the delivery sector lag? The delivery sector is going through a lot of changes every day. Different delivery apps and startups are bringing in other methods.\\\\nIn this blog today, we will discuss the marketing strategy of Zepto – one of the most prominent grocery delivery apps of the present time. The best part of Zepto marketing strategy is the 10-minute guarantee delivery. As a result, you can get groceries delivered to your doorstep that you previously purchased from the local general store.\\\\nWhat is Zepto? What Types of Companies Comes Under the Zepto Marketing Strategy?\\\\nZepto offers service only through the official application. At present, it has more than 80 dark stores throughout the country. These stores are primarily in tier one cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, and more. Zepto is a pan-India company that started its operations in April 2021. However, it was founded in September 2020.\\\\nThe primary reason Zepto has a successful business model in India is that Zepto marketing strategy includes producing 2500+ goods within 10 minutes. As a result, it was impossible for any top delivery or e-commerce sites.\\\\nWhether it is the marketing strategy of Zepto or any other marketing strategy, there are a lot of crucial factors. The idea is one of the most important ones of them. The Story of Zepto starts when the two founders, who were studying computer science, got tempted with their creative idea to start a business.\\\\nWith the idea to deliver food to your doorsteps in the least possible time, Zepto was introduced. The most crucial thing was that Zepto was introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the strict lockdown, when people were striving hard to get out of their homes, the founders worked hard to make the delivery possible even during the restrictions.\\\\nHow does Zepto Delivery Work? A Detail on Zepto Business Model\\\\nThe Zepto business model was inspired by the idea on which KiranaKart depends. KiranaKart depends on is for the local shopkeepers and managers. They deliver the goods and products within 45 minutes of placing the order. Zepto marketing strategy is based on similar ideas. Both the founders were bachelors, and they had to struggle a lot to get food delivered. This is where they got the idea of creating such an app that quickly provides grocery items.\\\\nAlso Read: 8 Compelling Reasons to Invest in a Grocery App Development Company\\\\nTheir vision is to open Zepto Dark stores all over India and expand the brand at the top level. They are planning to increase the team from 400 to 800 by 2023. You must think that Zepto app is the only company to be the fastest delivery online shopping app. At the same time, they are facing intense competition from rival companies like Swiggy, Zomato, Blinkit and Dunzo. The best part is all the competitors are offering the same service at equal rates.\\\\nTherefore, it was not easy to stay in the top place. Zepto marketing strategy required more business skills and investment to be the fastest delivery app in India. They introduced new standards to transform their work in the delivery infrastructure – right from the basic level. In simple words, ground-level work was still needed.\\\\nFunding & Investment for Zepto Marketing Strategy\\\\nThe leading sources for Zepto’s funds are Y combinator community funds and Glade brook capital partners. Both invested 100 million dollars and 4.4 billion rupees, respectively. Zepto has a successful business model in India, showing continuous growth. You can see the Zepto marketing strategy’s success from the number of stores they have opened across cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune and more.\\\\nAs the fastest delivery app in India, Zepto delivers grocery items only in the stores’ available areas. The technical office is in Bangalore. This is where all the technicalities are handled, while the operations are done from the Mumbai office. So, if you ask if the supermarket business is profitable in India, we will say YES. Why? Popular apps like Flipkart, Uber, Dream11 and more have their key executives in the Zepto app. Recently, Lazypay and Pescafresh partnered with Zepto.\\\\nZepto Talent Acquisition\\\\nAnother important thing that has worked in favour of a successful Zepto marketing strategy is acquiring talent. Top executives decided to join Zepto because it allowed so many people that had shifted to Bangalore to come back to Mumbai. However, the fast growth of the start-up, its ambition and the disciplined execution encouraged several people to be attracted to the company.\\\\nOrder Volume Claims\\\\nBlinkit & Instamart claimed that their weekly order volume increased to more than a million. So, the question is, what about Zepto? How many orders are they delivering now? Well, Zepto is not too keen to publish the numbers. However, they are saying that with the current numbers, they shall easily surpass the competitors in the market.\\\\nZepto Business Model: Dark Store Model\\\\nDark stores might seem a sinister option, but it is a great idea that helped multiple retail businesses stay afloat throughout the pandemic. The dark stores are distribution outlets that are not open to visitors. These are micro warehouses that quickly and accurately fulfil orders. Therefore, they offer shoppers resources and options like buying products online, pickup in-store and same-day delivery.\\\\nAccording to the founders and shareholders of the Zepto app, the magic of the dark store model is how they became the fastest delivery app in India. With the help of the dark stores, they could pick, pack, and dispatch the goods within 60 seconds. However, the last section is just like any other delivery model.\\\\nSuch a grocery delivery model is implemented in developed nations; however, the model was never explored in India. The dark store model reduces the trivial challenges that any delivery service faces. These include navigation, traffic congestion, and connectivity.\\\\nZepto marketing strategy used geography, location intelligence, population, road patterns, traffic dynamics, last-minute supply availability, weather, real estate values and others. All these factors improved the network’s overall performance.\\\\nDark stores are meant for instant deliveries and can’t handle the sales volume. However, the Zepto grocery app didn’t compromise on the shortcomings of this model. They have thousands of products on display, fresh produce, meat, milk, kitchen refills and more at the best bargain. Also, the AI-powered tool ensures a smooth transition, right from picking, packing, and delivering. All these features make the Zepto grocery app the fastest online shopping app.\\\\nBenefits of Zepto Business Model\\\\nThere are a lot of benefits to the Zepto Business Model. In the following section of the blog, we shall mention a few.\\\\n1. Better Distribution & Faster Delivery\\\\nThe dark store enables Zepto to fulfill orders quickly and more efficiently. In addition, the micro and cold warehouses offer several distribution choices and bring groceries closer to a particular market segment. Thus, you can see that Zepto has higher control over the market spread and distribution. It is another reason why Zepto is the fastest delivery app in India.\\\\n2. Better and Broader Customer Reach\\\\nOne of the dark stores’ most important features is bringing the distribution centres close to the consumers. The best thing about these stores is they are always online to take orders. It is what brings consumers to such platforms and uses their services. Therefore, it is one of the essential features that made the successful Zepto marketing strategy.\\\\n3. Contactless Shopping\\\\nThere is no denying the fact that the need for contact-free shopping is a critical factor for businesses to adopt the “dark store” approach. The dark stores allow consumers to purchase groceries in a contactless way without entering a physical store. All you must do is place orders, and you will get them instantly.\\\\n4. Better Inventory Control and Product Assortment\\\\nZepto’s business model and Zepto marketing strategy worked because they chose dark stores. The dark stores are customer-free zones, and they have better control over the inventory. Therefore, they can easily manage larger order volumes. In addition, the dark stores are designed to ensure easy navigation, allowing the packers to move quickly to pack the items in an order. Also, the AI-powered tools keep the inventory stock track and provide product assortment.\\\\nZepto’s USP\\\\nZepto’s business model is customer-centric, and it is an instant delivery model. However, Zepto offers a few selling points that set it apart from its competitors. Still, these are also included in the model.\\\\nOne of the main reasons the Zepto app is the fastest online shopping app is because Zepto has instant delivery and is regarded as quick commerce. They are capable enough to fulfill the grocery delivery in 10 minutes. Also, they claim to have a delivery time of 8 minutes and 47 seconds.\\\\nAccording to the founders, when a user checks the order, it is already shipped out for delivery. Therefore, it is another essential element that makes Zepto marketing strategy successful. They fulfill almost every order within 10 minutes. Only one percent of the charges might take 15-16 minutes.\\\\nAnother crucial factor for successful business models in India is to offer free shipping. Zepto offers free shipping. Even though this USP has got dim compared to the former one, it still doesn’t charge a delivery fee. On the other hand, Amazon Fresh & Instacart have delivery fees.\\\\nYou must remember that the free service doesn’t mean costlier products. Yet another USP is that it offers excellent discounts on its list of products and groceries.\\\\nZepto’s Online Ad Campaigns\\\\nZepto marketing campaigns are one of the best ones you shall see in the ad campaigns of recent companies. Zepto witnessed growth primarily because of its unique ad campaigns online. All of this they achieved in a short time. Did you know? L&K Saatchi & Saatchi was behind 3 of Zepto’s recent ads.\\\\nThe idea behind all Zepto’s ad campaigns is that time is an expandable commodity in India. Therefore, you cannot afford to waste it. Whether you must board a flight or wait for the food at a restaurant, we all have experienced stretchable time. It is where Zepto ad campaigns have stood apart.\\\\nHere are examples of the Zepto marketing strategy ad campaign where they surprisingly used three famous singers. Usha Uthup, Shankar Mahadevan & Kailash Kher are cast in unusual roles where they must stretch time in their way – thus highlighting the objective of Zepto, which is on-time delivery.\\\\nThe ad campaigns have paved the way for the Zepto app to be the most talked about brand.\\\\nHere’s What Zepto’s Chief Marketing Officer has to Say\\\\nAmritansu Nanda, Chief Marketing Officer of Zepto, says, “Our consumers lead busy, fast-paced lives. At Zepto, through our on-time delivery promise and at the back of our exceptional tech, we constantly strive to let them know and reassure them that we value their time.

Zepto is a case in point. From scripting these to presenting them to producing them, working on the campaign was an absolute pleasure, with the agency and client working as one team completely committed to the product. I think the results speak for themselves.\\\\nIn Conclusion\\\\nZepto marketing strategy has helped the brand to grow as the fastest delivery app in India. Zepto app has plans to expand into newer cities as quickly as possible. They are also planning to increase their coverage to micro-markets and be the leaders in the sector. Several other competitors are trying to participate in the market and grow quickly. However, they cannot promise things like 10-minute delivery consistently.

But what has driven its remarkable success?\\\\nLet’s take a closer look at Zepto’s marketing strategy and understand how this young startup became a force to be reckoned with in the competitive quick commerce landscape.\\\\nUnderstanding Zepto’s Marketing Mix\\\\nTo understand Zepto’s success, we need to break down its marketing mix. From the products it offers to its promotional tactics, every element plays a part in making Zepto a standout brand in the grocery delivery industry.\\\\n1. Product: A Promise of Speed and Convenience\\\\nZepto’s product offering revolves around the promise of convenience. The company delivers a wide variety of products ranging from groceries, fresh produce, household items, to personal care products—all in as little as 10 minutes. This ultra-fast delivery service has become the company’s hallmark, making it a go-to option for busy professionals, students, and families living in urban areas.\\\\nThe introduction of private-label products has also enhanced Zepto’s market appeal. By offering high-quality items at competitive prices, Zepto has not only captured customer interest but has also encouraged repeat business, thus fostering brand loyalty.\\\\n2. Price: Competitive Yet Sustainable\\\\nZepto’s pricing strategy is both competitive and sustainable. Unlike some competitors who rely heavily on deep discounts to attract customers, Zepto focuses on providing a value proposition that goes beyond pricing. The company offers attractive discounts and promotional offers, making it an appealing choice for budget-conscious consumers. However, the real game-changer is its focus on speed—something that traditional grocery delivery services don’t provide. This approach ensures that Zepto’s customers receive more than just low prices; they receive unparalleled service in terms of delivery speed.\\\\n3. Place: Convenience at Your Fingertips\\\\nZepto’s business model revolves around making grocery shopping as easy and efficient as possible for its customers. The platform operates primarily through a mobile app that enables users to place orders quickly and effortlessly. The app is designed with a user-friendly interface, catering to tech-savvy, time-conscious customers who value convenience.\\\\nZepto also uses a dark store model to ensure fast order fulfillment. These fulfillment centers, though not open to the public, are strategically located to facilitate swift deliveries. The dark store model allows Zepto to manage inventory efficiently and ensure that deliveries are completed in record time.\\\\n4. Promotion: Building a Strong Brand Identity\\\\nZepto’s promotional strategy is diverse and impactful, utilizing both traditional and digital channels to establish a strong brand presence. A key component of its promotional efforts is its focus on advertising and branding. Partnering with the advertising agency L&K Saatchi and Saatchi, Zepto created campaigns that emphasize its unique 10-minute delivery promise. The brand’s ads are designed to captivate and engage viewers by highlighting everyday situations where time is of the essence, ultimately showcasing how Zepto can solve this problem with its rapid delivery service.\\\\nAdditionally, Zepto has adopted social media meme marketing, a clever and engaging way to reach younger audiences. By creating memes around current events, pop culture, and trending topics, Zepto has been able to connect with its audience in a light-hearted, relatable manner. This not only helps the brand stay relevant but also builds a strong community around its product.\\\\nThe 10-Minute Delivery Strategy: A Game-Changer\\\\nWhen Zepto entered the market, it was not the first company to offer online grocery delivery. However, it was the first to promise deliveries in just 10 minutes—a unique selling point that set the brand apart from the competition. In the highly competitive world of quick commerce, speed is everything. Zepto’s 10-minute delivery service has proven to be its defining feature, allowing it to attract a loyal customer base.\\\\nAchieving such rapid delivery times is no easy feat. To fulfill its promise, Zepto relies on the dark store model, which enables efficient packing and dispatching of orders. Once a customer places an order, the system ensures that it is picked, packed, and dispatched within a minute. Zepto also uses advanced technology, including artificial intelligence, to streamline the entire process, from inventory management to delivery logistics. With an average delivery time of just 8 minutes and 47 seconds, Zepto is living up to its commitment of ultra-fast service.\\\\nAdvertising and Branding: Creating Buzz and Building Trust\\\\nZepto’s advertising strategy is another key factor that has contributed to its success. Through clever, engaging campaigns, the company has been able to capture the public’s attention and create a strong brand identity. One of its most successful campaigns featured the idea of waiting—something we all do in everyday life, whether it’s waiting in line at an airport or waiting for food at a restaurant. In the campaign, Zepto cleverly juxtaposes the frustration of waiting with its promise of 10-minute delivery, showing that while many things in life take time, Zepto’s service doesn’t.\\\\nBeyond traditional ads, Zepto also made waves with its innovative use of meme marketing. By leveraging the power of humor and social media trends, Zepto has created a relatable, fun brand that resonates with younger audiences. This approach not only garners attention but also promotes organic engagement, as users share Zepto’s memes across their networks.\\\\nCustomer Acquisition and Retention: Building Loyalty with Speed and Service\\\\nOne of the challenges for Zepto in such a competitive market was acquiring and retaining customers. While discounts and offers can attract new users, they don’t necessarily ensure long-term loyalty. Zepto, however, focuses on creating a unique experience that keeps customers coming back. The company’s commitment to ultra-fast delivery, combined with its excellent customer service, has led to impressive customer retention rates.\\\\nZepto also leverages referral programs to drive customer acquisition. The referral system rewards existing users for referring new customers, making it an effective strategy for growing its user base. By offering incentives for both the referrer and the referee, Zepto ensures that customers are motivated to spread the word about the service.\\\\nZepto’s Unique Selling Proposition (USP)\\\\nWhat truly sets Zepto apart from its competitors is its ability to deliver groceries in 10 minutes without compromising on the quality or price of the products. This quick delivery model, coupled with free shipping, offers customers a compelling reason to choose Zepto over other grocery delivery services, many of which charge for delivery. Zepto’s ability to maintain competitive prices while offering faster service has made it a preferred choice for urban dwellers.\\\\nConclusion: A Rising Star in Quick Commerce\\\\nZepto’s meteoric rise in the quick commerce industry is a testament to the power of innovation, speed, and smart marketing. By focusing on customer needs—specifically, the desire for speed and convenience—Zepto has carved out a niche in a crowded market. With a combination of creative advertising, meme marketing, and an unbeatable delivery speed, Zepto has become the go-to app for time-conscious consumers.\\\\nIn a short time, Zepto has achieved what many of its competitors have struggled to do: build a loyal customer base, establish a strong brand identity, and deliver on its promises.

This step coincides with the company’s ambition to expand and explore new revenue options, with growing attention on food delivery service. Even though Zepto is going to launch a separate app for ordering coffee, sandwiches, and other items, these items can still be purchased in the Zepto app. This new service is already gaining momentum.\\\\nPalicha shared on X that the new app is growing rapidly by posting, “Cafe is expanding quickly: we\\\\\\'re opening over 100 cafes monthly and currently processing 30,000 orders daily,” on X platform. Earlier this year, Zepto mentioned that Cafe contributes significantly to their business. At present, it is achieving an annualised revenue run rate (ARR) of Rs 160 crore, with projections to reach Rs 1,000 crore in ARR by 2026.\\\\nFor an extended period, analysts, founders, and other participants have discussed whether companies should adopt the Zomato approach (super apps) where a new service is launched as an independent app, or the Swiggy method (super brands) where all new services are made available through one primary app. Currently, Zepto\\\\\\'s strategy combines aspects of both.\\\\nWith the growing quick commerce business in India, big players like Swiggy, Swish, Zepto, and Zomato are keen to explore new options in the booming industry of expedited food delivery services in India.\\\\nGet Latest News Live on Times Now along with Breaking News and Top Headlines from Companies, Business Economy and around the world.\\\\nTrending:\\\\nPriyadarshini Singh author\\\\nPriyadarshini Singh is a language, culture, and human psychology enthusiast, specializing in Korean linguistics with advanced proficiency in the langu...View More\\\\nEnd of Article\\\\nSubscribe to our daily Newsletter!\\\\n\\\\\\'We Are All Positioned to Help Transform India Into a Developed Country In Near Future\\\\\\': Times Group MD Vineet Jain\\\\nTrump’s Global Tariff Blitz Hits 180 Nations: Indian Exporters Brace for Impact - What Gets Costlier?\\\\nCooking Gas Cylinder Costlier By Rs 50 — Check New LPG Prices\\\\nExcise Duty Hiked By Rs 2 On Petrol And Diesel - How Does It Impact You?\\\\n‘Make in India’ Gains Traction as Apple, Samsung Reroute Exports to US\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto, the quick commerce platform, is set to introduce a dedicated app for its Cafe offerings next week, announced its co-founder and CEO.\\\\nAadit Palicha, co-founder and CEO of Zepto, announced the strategic move on social media, emphasizing the company\\\\\\'s rapid growth and innovative approach. \"We\\\\\\'re launching a separate app for Zepto Café next week! The team is shipping an MVP and iterating quickly, so it may not be perfect on Day 1, but it\\\\\\'s worth it to launch fast :D Café is scaling rapidly: we\\\\\\'re launching 100+ Cafés a month and already clocking 30K orders/day.\"\\\\nWhile the Cafe offerings will be available through the new standalone app, customers can still access these services via the main Zepto application. This approach mirrors\\\\nZomato\\\\\\'s strategy with Blinkit, providing multiple entry points for consumer engagement.\\\\nThe new app comes at a time of intense competition in India\\\\\\'s quick commerce sector, with major players like Swiggy and Zomato also exploring rapid food delivery services.\\\\nThe launch aligns with Zepto\\\\\\'s broader expansion plans, which include scaling from its current presence in about two dozen cities to over 50 cities in the next quarter. The company recently surpassed a billion dollars in top-line revenue and is targeting profitability in the upcoming fiscal year.\\\\n                \\\\n                MUMBAI: Instant delivery is the new way of life. After grocery and a host of other non-grocery household supplies, 10-minute delivery is fast becoming a fad in the food space. Taking competition directly to the doors of Zomato and Swiggy, Zepto is launching a separate app for quicker deliveries of food, branded as Zepto Café, allowing consumers to get chai, samosa and pizza delivered to their doorstep in 10 minutes. Indians are familiar with 30-minute delivery of certain food items like pizzas but with quick commerce changing the way people consume and transact, consumers are taking to rapid delivery of food and players like Zepto and Swiggy are trying to capitalise on the trend. “For consumers looking to get food in 10 minutes, it doesn’t matter if the food is coming from Zepto Café or Zomato. For them, Zepto Café is also now an option for ordering their sandwich and samosa. Zepto is playing on the strength of 10-minute delivery. Competition in the food delivery space will increase—ultimately, the money that will be spent on Zepto café will come from the wallet of a Zomato or Swiggy customer,” Satish Meena, advisor at Datum Intelligence told TOI. Zepto competes with Zomato’s Blinkit and Swiggy Instamart in the broader quick commerce market.\\\\nUntil now, consumers could only order café products through the main Zepto app; that option will continue to be available. To be sure, Zepto does not follow a food aggregator model or partner with restaurant brands unlike Zomato and Swiggy. It sources ingredients and ready to eat food items from local vendors and uses a network of kitchens stationed within its dark stores to cook and heat up the products before deliveries. Currently, it offers only a select menu but plans are afoot to broaden it going ahead. “We have speed ovens and coffee machines within our kitchens. It takes us less than two minutes to cook everything in the menu,” a company spokesperson said. In October, Swiggy had launched its 10-minute food delivery offering Bolt; Zomato currently delivers everyday (home made) meals in 15 minutes although industry experts said that the company may also look to push a 10-minute offering into the market soon. Analysts do not completely rule out the possibility of Zepto considering partnering with restaurant brands and offering full-fledged food delivery service like Zomato and Swiggy sometime going ahead. “If the Zepto Café app works, they always have the option of expanding into broader food delivery. Once Zepto Cafe gets customer traffic, restaurants will also be keen on joining them,” said Meena.\\\\nZepto Café operates across 15% of the quick commerce firm’s 600 odd dark stores and is limited to six cities as of now but with the separate app going live next week, the plan is to scale up the offering to cover all dark stores and cities where Zepto operates. “There is a significant consumer top-of-mind advantage to a separate app and we are seeing the economics work standalone. So, a standalone app makes sense,” said Aadit Palicha, co-founder and CEO at Zepto which claims that its café offering sees 30,000 orders per day.\\\\n                \\\\n                The quick commerce battle is rapidly moving into the food space.\\\\nZepto and Blinkit have made moves towards their 10-minute delivery food delivery options on successive days. Yesterday, Zepto had announced Zepto Cafe, which delivered food in 10 minutes. Today, Blinkit appears to have launched an app named Bistro which will similarly deliver food in 10 minutes.\\\\n“We’re launching a separate app for Zepto Café next week!” Zepto CEO Aadit Palicha had posted yesterday on X. “The team is shipping an MVP and iterating quickly, so it may not be perfect on Day 1, but it’s worth it to launch fast 😀 Café is scaling rapidly: we’re launching 100+ Cafés a month and already clocking 30K orders/day,” he had added. Palicha had added a screenshot of the Zepto Cafe app, which seemed to be waiting for approvals on the App store.\\\\nBut Today users discovered that Zepto’s arch rival Blinkit too appears to have launched its 10-minute food delivery app. Named Bistro, the app is already live on the Play Store. It’s already been downloaded over a thousand times, and has a rating of 4.8 after 24 reviews. Bistro says it’ll deliver delicious food in minutes, and offers more than 50 dishes including Adrak Chai, Indori Poha and croissants.\\\\nInterestingly, the third player, Swiggy, already has a 10-minute food delivery app available named Swiggy Bolt. Swiggy Bolt is already available in 400+ cities and towns in India, and delivers over 10 lakh food items through 40,000 participating restaurants. “Designed for speed, Bolt focuses on dishes that can be delivered without compromising on taste, freshness, or quality,” Swiggy had said in a press release last week. Swiggy said that it had partnered with restaurants to optimize order prioritization for Bolt orders, which only had food items with minimum or no preparation time. It had added that delivery partners were not told which orders were ordered through Bolt and which were regular orders to prevent reckless driving — it indicated that Swiggy had optimized the order flow with restaurants to make sure orders reached users in 10 minutes.\\\\nSwiggy, Blinkit and Zepto are each converging on the 10-minute food ordering space from different starting points. Zomato and Swiggy already have large food delivery operations, so they likely already have relationships with restaurants to be able to quickly launch 10-minute food delivery. Zepto doesn’t have a dedicated food ordering arm, but had earlier made snack deliveries available through its main app, so it appears to be extending that with a separate app in Zepto Cafe. All these companies vociferously compete in the quick commerce space, and now appear to be making moves in the 10-minute food delivery space which they clearly seem to believe is ripe for the picking.\\\\nStrategically, it would make the most sense for Zepto to push heavily on food delivery. Zomato and Swiggy will likely cannibalize a portion of their regular orders to 10-minute delivery, but food delivery can be a whole new greenfield operation for Zepto. Additionally, 10-minute food delivery helps all these players stand out from ONDC, which offers food delivery in regular times. These are frenetic times in India’s food delivery space, and with several competitors competing over services, discounts, and delivery timings, the Indian consumer has never had a better chance to have their cake and eat it too.\\\\n                \\\\n                Indian quick commerce upstart Zepto is now rolling out a standalone app for Zepto Cafe, its 10-minute food delivery service. Aadit Palicha, CEO of Zepto, announced the same in a post on X. The standalone app will roll out sometime next week.\\\\n“We’re launching a separate app for Zepto Café next week! The team is shipping an MVP and iterating quickly, so it may not be perfect on Day 1, but it’s worth it to launch fast :D Café is scaling rapidly: we’re launching 100+ Cafés a month and already clocking 30K orders/day 🚀,” the post read.\\\\nWe\\\\\\'re launching a separate app for Zepto Café next week!

Since its inception, the service has experienced impressive growth, with Zepto expanding by over 100 new cafes per month. Currently, Zepto Cafe handles upwards of 30,000 orders daily.\\\\nIn terms of operational scale, Zepto Cafe is currently functioning across about 15% of Zepto’s expansive dark store network, which includes over 600 locations. As the company continues to grow, it plans to expand Zepto Cafe’s coverage to its entire network, which will encompass more than 25 cities in the coming months. Zepto Cafe is currently available for users in several cities across the country, including Gurgaon, Delhi, Bengaluru, and Mumbai.\\\\nThe numbers are in Zepto Cafe’s favour – it has already achieved an annualized revenue run rate (ARR) of ₹160 crore, with projections to reach ₹1,000 crore by 2026. Going forward, the Bengaluru-headquartered firm plans to add new offerings to the menu in a bid to attract a wider range of customers, especially those seeking quick and diverse food options. The company has announced that starting December 16, it will offer 4 million free Vietnamese Cold Coffees as part of a promotional campaign to attract new customers.\\\\nThis begs the question: why is Zepto rolling out a separate app for the service? As mentioned earlier, users could previously access Zepto Cafe through the main Zepto app, alongside other services like groceries and household products. With a dedicated app for the food delivery service, the quick commerce firm will be able to improve visibility and customer engagement for Zepto Cafe, as well as streamline the company’s offerings.\\\\nPalicha cites the “significant consumer top-of-mind advantage” that a standalone app provides as part of the rationale behind this development. “There is a significant consumer top-of-mind advantage to a separate app and we are seeing the economics work stand-alone. So, a stand-alone app makes sense. Users will still be able to order Café products on the main Zepto app,” he said.\\\\n                \\\\n                None\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto Launches New App for 10-Minute Food Delivery: A Game-Changer in Quick Commerce\\\\nNews Synopsis\\\\nIn a move to capitalize on the growing demand for ultra-fast food delivery, Zepto, the quick commerce company known for its lightning-fast deliveries, is set to launch a new standalone app for Zepto Cafe.\\\\nThis new platform, dedicated to the company’s 10-minute food delivery services, will be launched next week, according to a December 11 post by Zepto co-founder and CEO Aadit Palicha.\\\\nThe introduction of the Zepto Cafe app marks a strategic expansion as the company continues to explore new ways to scale its food delivery offerings.\\\\nA Dual-App Strategy: Zepto Cafe and Main Zepto App\\\\nWhile Zepto Cafe will be available through its own app, customers will still have the option to shop for café items like coffee, sandwiches, and more directly through the main Zepto app. This dual-entry approach mirrors a strategy seen earlier with Zomato, which split its services into separate apps, such as Blinkit, to enhance user experience and business performance.\\\\nIndustry analysts have long debated whether food delivery platforms should follow the \"super app\" approach, similar to Swiggy, which consolidates services into one platform, or the \"super brand\" model, adopted by Zomato for different offerings like Blinkit. Zepto’s strategy currently blends elements of both approaches, with a dedicated app for its café offerings and a consolidated main platform for broader services.\\\\nAn industry insider explained the rationale behind this strategy:\\\\n“There is a significant top-of-mind advantage to a separate app and Zepto is seeing the economics work stand-alone. So, a stand-alone app makes sense while also keeping a free channel of acquisition alive on the main Zepto app.”\\\\nRapid Growth of Zepto Cafe and Scaling Plans\\\\nZepto Cafe has been scaling at a remarkable pace. According to Palicha, the company is expanding its café business quickly, launching over 100 cafes a month and already processing more than 30,000 orders daily. The growth of Zepto Cafe is significant, with the company projecting annualized revenue of Rs 160 crore for the segment, which it expects to grow to Rs 1,000 crore in the next few years, by 2026.\\\\nPalicha’s social media update highlighted the success of the venture:\\\\n“Cafe is scaling rapidly: we’re launching 100+ cafes a month and already clocking 30,000 orders per day.”\\\\nCompeting in the 10-Minute Food Delivery Race\\\\nZepto’s latest move comes at a time when the race for 10-minute food delivery is becoming increasingly competitive in India. The market has seen rapid growth, with numerous startups and established companies vying to capitalize on consumer demand for ultra-fast food delivery.\\\\nFor instance, last month, Swish, a new entrant in the rapid food delivery space, raised $2 million from Accel and angel investors to compete with Zepto Cafe, Swiggy’s Bolt, and Zomato’s Everyday. Swiggy Bolt alone accounts for 5 percent of all food delivery orders, indicating the growing market share for these fast food services.\\\\nZomato’s CEO, Deepinder Goyal, and Swiggy’s CEO, Sriharsha Majety, have both emphasized in interviews that 10-minute food deliveries are poised to become the next major frontier in the industry.\\\\nAs consumer expectations evolve and demand for speed intensifies, quick commerce companies like Zepto are increasingly focusing on streamlining their delivery models to stay ahead of the competition.\\\\nZepto’s Long-Term Strategy in Quick Commerce\\\\nZepto’s launch of a dedicated app for Zepto Cafe signals its commitment to building a strong presence in the rapidly growing 10-minute food delivery sector. By combining a separate app for cafe-related services with its core Zepto platform, the company aims to enhance user experience, improve scalability, and ultimately capture a larger share of the market.\\\\nAs the quick commerce landscape evolves, Zepto’s strategic decisions will play a crucial role in defining its position in the competitive food delivery space. Whether other companies follow suit in adopting a dual-app strategy remains to be seen, but Zepto’s move certainly sets the stage for an even more intense battle in India’s fast-paced food delivery sector.\\\\nConclusion:\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s decision to launch a standalone app for its Zepto Cafe offering highlights the company’s commitment to capturing a larger share of the rapidly growing 10-minute food delivery market. By adopting a dual-app strategy, Zepto aims to enhance user experience while maintaining a streamlined approach to its core services.\\\\nThis move comes at a time when competition in the quick commerce sector is intensifying, with both Swiggy and Zomato also expanding their 10-minute food delivery services.\\\\nWith impressive growth in the Zepto Cafe segment, marked by a fast-paced rollout of new cafes and a high volume of daily orders, Zepto is positioning itself as a key player in the evolving quick commerce landscape.\\\\nThe company’s projected revenue growth and commitment to scaling its café offerings signal a bright future for its 10-minute delivery business.\\\\nAs the industry continues to innovate and evolve, Zepto’s strategic approach will likely serve as a model for others looking to capitalize on the growing demand for ultra-fast food delivery in India.\\\\nThe competition between food delivery giants is only expected to escalate, but with a clear focus on consumer demands and operational efficiency, Zepto appears well-positioned to maintain its competitive edge in the 10-minute food delivery race.\\\\nYou May Like\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto to launch a separate app for Zepto Cafe as popularity boosts\\\\nPlans for Zepto Cafe\\\\\\'s separate app come as the offering scale to 30k orders a day and as Zepto adds more than 100 cafes a month.\\\\nQuick commerce unicorn Zepto plans to launch a separate app for Zepto Café next week, according to the company\\\\\\'s Co-Founder and CEO Palicha.\\\\n\"Café is scaling rapidly: we\\\\\\'re launching 100+ Cafés a month and already clocking 30K orders/day,\" stated Co-Founder and CEO Aadit Palicha in a post on X.\\\\nWhile there is a separate tab for Cafe and Super Saver in the Zepto app now, but consumers are still able to place a combined order between cafe items and groceries. There is no clarity on whether this will be possible with the new app.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s plans to launch a separate app for Cafe hint at a broader difference of opinion in the sector. The remaining two bigger players are battling on the merits of Swiggy\\\\\\'s super app strategy against Zomato\\\\\\'s super brands\\\\\\' strategy.\\\\nJust last month, Zepto announced the rollout of its cafe services in major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and soon in Hyderabad, Chennai, and Pune.\\\\nIts Cafe, which offers over 148 items, including freshly brewed chai, coffee, all-day breakfast, pastries, and savoury snacks, currently targets a revenue run-rate of Rs 1000 crore by 2026.\\\\nThe company said in November that it is achieving an (estimated) Annual Run Rate (ARR) GMV of Rs 160 crore with just 15% of its expanding dark store network, which has proven unit economics.\\\\nSwiggy\\\\\\'s Bolt, a 10-minute food delivery service, already accounts for 5% of its total food delivery orders, within just two months of its launch.

The team is shipping an MVP and iterating quickly, so it may not be perfect on Day 1, but it\\\\\\'s worth it to launch fast,” Palicha posted on X.\\\\nHe also added that Zepto Cafe is scaling rapidly, with the firm launching more than 100 Cafes per month and already clocking 30,000 orders per day.\\\\nZepto Cafe, launched in 2022, offers a combination of branded and non-branded food items. This vertical has increased average order values as customers frequently add beverages and snacks to their grocery orders.\\\\nEarlier, Zepto stated that Cafe is clocking an annualized revenue run rate of Rs 160 crore and is projected to reach Rs 1,000 crore by 2026.\\\\nZepto recently raised $350 million in a funding round led by Motilal Oswal Private Wealth at a valuation of $5 billion.

The owners of Zepto, Aadit Palicha, and Kaivalya Vohra launched Zepto to provide customers with ultra-fast grocery delivery.\\\\nSpecializing in delivering groceries before the turn of a year is what Zepto is hailed for. It has worked with 86+ dark store owners in 13 different areas in 2021, generating over one million deliveries. To fulfill orders promptly, Zepto employs its network of \\\\\\'cloud shops\\\\\\' or micro-warehouses.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s secret of the trade lies in its capacity to routinely offer an extensive range of goods for delivery in under ten minutes. It\\\\\\'s at the heart of everything the company does, and it\\\\\\'s why they\\\\\\'ve been able to grow so quickly while maintaining incredible client loyalty.\\\\nZepto operates in multiple cities with a 1000+ strong workforce and delivers 25000+ products, including fresh produce, daily essentials, health products, and more, within 10 minutes. Utilizing advanced technology and optimized delivery centers, the company is transforming the Indian grocery segment. With rapid commerce on the rise, Zepto\\\\\\'s innovative approach positions it as a leader in the grocery delivery sector, capitalizing on the growing demand for faster delivery services in India.\\\\nZepto - Industry\\\\nAs per IMARC Group\\\\\\'s analysis, the Indian online grocery market attained a value of $6.8 billion in 2022. Looking ahead, the market is anticipated to experience substantial growth and is projected to reach $37.0 billion by 2028. This growth trajectory indicates a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31.3% during the period from 2023 to 2028.\\\\nThe sector has expanded in prevalence in the past few years as a result of evolving customer habits, growing urbanization, and a tech-savvy generation that prefers to make online purchases.\\\\nAs per RedSeer, India\\\\\\'s quick commerce market is set for impressive growth, projected to expand by 10–15 times by 2025 and reach a market size of nearly $5.5 billion. This substantial growth is expected to surpass other markets, including China, in terms of quick commerce adoption.\\\\nAs their standard of living increases and their daily schedules get tighter, consumers are flocking to customized and convenient internet platforms for grocery shopping instead of walking down to the local shops.\\\\nFollowing the COVID-19 pandemic, the popularity of online grocery delivery became increasingly evident. As a consequence of social distancing constraints, consumers are converting to online grocery shopping, which is not only convenient but also safer.\\\\nZepto - Founders and Team\\\\nAadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, both 19-year-old childhood pals, founded Zepto after walking out of Stanford University\\\\\\'s renowned computer science department to return to their home country, India, and start up a business. The Zepto company began its operations in April 2021.\\\\nKaivalya Vohra\\\\nKaivalya Vohra is the CTO and Co-Founder of Zepto. He was also the founder and CTO of KiranaKart. He also attended Stanford University to pursue a degree in Computer Science, but like Aadit, he decided to leave the university. Kaivalya, along with Aadit, participated in Y Combinator as well.\\\\nAadit Palicha\\\\nAadit Palicha is the CEO and Co-Founder of Zepto. He was also the founder and CEO of KiranaKart. After completing an IB diploma from GEMS Education in Mathematics and Computer Science, Palicha then went for a Bachelor\\\\\\'s degree in Computer Science from Stanford University, however, he quit the program in the middle to launch his firm. Aadit then completed Y Combinator Grade: W21 and started with PryvaSee as a Project Lead. Aadit Palicha then founded GoPool, his first startup, when he was just 17. He left the same in April 2020 and founded KiranaKart and then Zepto.\\\\nFlaunt your startup with StartupTalky\\\\n800+ stories, thousands of founders, and millions of visitors.

Inviting founders and startups who are building sustainable solutions from ground zero! Startups who run the show, StartupTalky will let the world know!\\\\nZepto - Startup Story\\\\nMany of us have \"startup ideas,\" but even the most creative among us struggle to see them through. Palicha and Vohra had both enrolled at Stanford to earn a Computer Science degree but had dropped out to follow their business passions instead.\\\\nThe story of Zepto started during the COVID-19 outbreak. The concept for Zepto sprang from the limitations of their houses. A surge in demand for delivery services meant that groceries and other necessities would arrive in a couple of days, creating a void for quick delivery. As a result, Zepto was created with all this insight.\\\\nThese teenagers were abruptly detained, because of Covid norms, detained in their Mumbai homes after significant collaboration on many projects, including a ride-hailing commuting app for kids. Even while grocery delivery, which was deemed important by local authorities, was still permitted across much of the nation as the virus spread, the duo battled to get their provisions as the illness expanded.\\\\nWhile Zepto is the focus of attention, Palicha and Vohra\\\\\\'s first venture, KiranaKart, did not receive the same acclaim. Zepto, on the other hand, is inspired by KiranaKart. KiranaKart, as its name implies, was a supermarket delivery service. It had made arrangements with Kirana merchants to provide groceries in 45 minutes or less. A $730,000 pre-seed round was led by Global Founders Capital, 2 AM Ventures, Contrary Capital, and angel investors. At the time, Vohra and Palicha planned to make the first 1.5 lakh deliveries for INR 1.\\\\nZepto - Mission and Vision\\\\nAs two bachelors living alone, the founders found it most difficult to obtain food, therefore, they focused their applications on grocery delivery. So, whereas KiranaKart, their first startup, tried to make grocery delivery easier for Kiranas, Zepto aims to shorten delivery times.\\\\nZepto - Name, Logo, and Tagline\\\\nThe firm, which uses the term \"Zepto\" to denote \"a factor of 10⁻²¹, i.e. 0.000000000000000000001,\" named after a minuscule unit of time, offers a 10-minute grocery delivery service, surpassing numerous well-funded competitors.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s tagline says, \"Groceries delivered in 10 minutes\".\\\\nZepto - Business and Revenue Model\\\\nZepto delivers groceries in ten minutes through a system of dark storefronts and mini-warehouses, on up to 90% of orders. Zepto works in the quick commerce segment of India. It is designed to be customer-centric and built around the instant service model.\\\\nTo ensure a flawless delivery experience, Aadit says that their average delivery time is 8 minutes and 47 seconds. Through a chain of dark stores or retail distribution centers, the Mumbai-based company employs a hotspot method to cater largely to digital purchases.\\\\nA dark store is a tiny neighborhood storehouse that customers cannot visit but purchase online to get packaged delivery. While dark stores are not new to the Indian industry, Aadit believes that the idea has yet to be completely explored. Population, traffic dynamics, topography, road patterns, weather conditions, last-mile operational improvement, real estate prices, and other geographic data and local intelligence aid Zepto in optimizing its connectivity. Furthermore, the startup\\\\\\'s dark warehouses and cool rooms are custom-designed to satisfy particular criteria such as ease of travel, allowing packers to move as swiftly as possible to fill orders.\\\\nLocation intelligence and geographic data, such as topography, population, road patterns, traffic dynamics, weather, last-mile supply availability, real estate values, and so on, are said to help Zepto optimize its network.\\\\nZepto - Funding and Investors\\\\nZepto, the Mumbai-based quick commerce unicorn, achieved unicorn status in August 2023 after raising $200 million in a Series E funding round, which brought its valuation to $1.4 billion. This milestone marked the end of India\\\\\\'s 11-month unicorn drought. The Series E round was led by The StepStone Group, with participation from Goodwater Capital and existing investors.\\\\nIn June 2024, Zepto raised $665 million, which valued the company at $3.6 billion. Just a few months later, on August 30, 2024, Zepto raised $340 million in Series G funding, which increased its valuation to $5 billion. The Series G round was led by General Catalyst, with Dragon Fund and Epiq Capital joining as new investors. Existing backers such as StepStone, Lightspeed, DST, and Contrary also increased their investments, reflecting strong confidence in Zepto\\\\\\'s growth potential.\\\\nIn November 2024, Zepto raised another $350 million from a group of domestic investors, led by Motilal Oswal\\\\\\'s private wealth division, at a flat valuation of $5 billion. This brings the total funding raised by Zepto to $2 billion.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s initial seed funding in September 2020 was led by Contrary.\\\\n| Date | Round | Amount | Lead Investors |\\\\n|---|---|---|---|\\\\n| November 21, 2024 | Series G | $350 | Motilal Oswal Wealth |\\\\n| August 30, 2024 | Series G | $340 million | General Catalyst, Mars Growth Capital |\\\\n| June 21, 2024 | Series F | $665 million | Glade Brook Capital Partners, Nexus Venture Partners, StepStone Group |\\\\n| Nov 8, 2023 | Series E | $31.3 million | Goodwater Capital, Nexus Venture Partners |\\\\n| Aug 25, 2023 | Series E | $200 million | StepStone Group |\\\\n| May 2, 2022 | Series D | $200 million | Y Combinator Continuity Fund |\\\\n| Dec 20, 2021 | Series C | $100 million | Y Combinator Continuity Fund |\\\\n| Oct 31, 2021 | Series B | $60 million | Glade Brook Capital Partners |\\\\n| Mar 22, 2021 | Series A | $6.5 million | Nexus Venture Partners |\\\\n| Sep 1, 2020 | Pre Seed Round | - | Contrary |\\\\nZepto - Shareholding\\\\nZepto shareholding pattern as of October 2024 (source: Tracxn):\\\\n| Zepto Shareholders | Percentage |\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n| Aadit Palicha | 0.9% |\\\\n| Kaivalya Vohra | 0.7% |\\\\n| Nexus Venture Partners | 18.6% |\\\\n| Glade Brook Capital | 10.3% |\\\\n| StepStone Group | 9.8% |\\\\n| Y Combinator | 8.7% |\\\\n| LGF Scale I | 7.8% |\\\\n| Rocket Internet | 3.0% |\\\\n| General Catalyst | 4.1% |\\\\n| Goodwater Capital | 1.8% |\\\\n| Razor\\\\\\'s Edge Ventures | 1.6% |\\\\n| Contrary | 1.6% |\\\\n| Kaiser Permanente | 2.3% |\\\\n| avra | 1.3% |\\\\n| SpringBlue Capital | 1.0% |\\\\n| Lightspeed Venture Partners | 0.8% |\\\\n| Global Founders Capital | 0.8% |\\\\n| Crimson | 0.5% |\\\\n| Vanderbilt University | 0.3% |\\\\n| Mangum | 0.3% |\\\\n| Bayhouse Capital | 0.2% |\\\\n| Mehta Ventures | <0.1% |\\\\n| Contrary Capital | <0.1% |\\\\n| Zpt Holdings | 2.1% |\\\\n| AZ04 | 1.4% |\\\\n| Kiranakart SPV | 0.6% |\\\\n| Sayacorps | 0.4% |\\\\n| C Opportunities | 0.1% |\\\\n| Jung Lish Lee | 2.3% |\\\\n| Oliver Jung | 0.7% |\\\\n| Oleg Wladimir Nicolas Tscheltzoff | 0.2% |\\\\n| Aditi Javesh Jhaveri | <0.1% |\\\\n| Manoj Chawla | <0.1% |\\\\n| Kavit Dilip Palicha | 8.0% |\\\\n| Jaideep Vohra | 6.7% |\\\\n| Other Investors | 1.0% |\\\\nAmong the shareholders, Nexus Venture Partners holds the largest stake, holding 18.6% of Zepto. Other prominent owners of Zepto include Y Combinator, Glade Brook Capital, StepStone Group, and co-founders Aadit Palicha (along with Kavit Dilip Palicha) and Kaivalya Vohra (along with Jaideep Vohra), among others.\\\\nZepto - IPO\\\\nZepto plans to go public in 2025. To prepare for its IPO, the company set up a new entity, Zepto Marketplace Private Limited, in October 2024 to simplify its operations. Zepto currently operates under a B2B model, sourcing products directly from brands and selling them to its partner companies, which then distribute the products to customers under a licensing agreement.\\\\nIn January 2025, Zepto completed its domicile shift from Singapore to India ahead of its IPO, which is now expected to raise between $800 million and $1 billion, including secondaries. Initially, the company targeted a $450 million primary capital raise.\\\\nZepto has hired Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Axis Capital as advisors for the IPO. This marks a key step in its journey as a leader in the quick commerce industry.\\\\nZepto - Growth and Revenue\\\\nZepto has seen impressive growth, serving 10 major cities with 1,000+ employees. They deliver more than 5,000 products, revolutionizing the Indian grocery segment with 10-minute delivery, advanced tech, and optimized centers.\\\\nEngineering, operations, marketing, and financial positions are also available at Zepto. Palicha claims that month-over-month growth is 200%, with a monthly retention rate of 78%.\\\\n“We are looking at a pretty crazy runrate,” he said. “In the past one and a half months, we have grown our business by 10 times. And now we are working to grow another 10 times by February or March,” said Palicha in December 2021.\\\\nZepto, when it was a five-month-old startup, had secured a valuation of $570 million after raising $100 million in a Series C round headed by Y Combinator\\\\\\'s Continuity Fund, which was a 2X increase from its previous valuation of $60 million only 45 days before that. Zepto raised another round led by Y Combinator to lift its valuation further to $900 million, so there is certainly impressive growth that the company has received in funding as well.\\\\nAnother positive development for Zepto has been the expertise it has been able to acquire. Plenty of well-known senior executives from Uber, Flipkart, Dream11, Amazon, and Pharmeasy have joined the team.\\\\nAccording to Palicha, one of the reasons why several entrepreneurs have chosen Zepto is that it has enabled individuals who had transferred from Mumbai to Bangalore to come back to their homes. He says, nevertheless, that the startup\\\\\\'s rapid development, rigorous execution, and ambitions have captivated others who share his interests. \"We\\\\\\'ve been able to walk the walk,\" he said.\\\\n“They originally launched with a different model, swiftly pivoted to quick commerce in August 2021 and are now adding 100,000 new customers every week, 60% of them women. Their attention to detail on the logistics experience is unparalleled and this has enabled them to scale to most major metros in just 5 months. Simply put, we’re confident Zepto will win in this space over the long-term,\" said Anu Hariharan, a partner at Y Combinator, in a statement.\\\\nZepto has demonstrated significant growth in recent times, with the majority of its dark stores now operating profitably. According to co-founder and CEO Aadit Palicha, Zepto has successfully established its presence in major metro cities in India with over 300-400 dark stores.

With a strong lineup of investors and a clear roadmap for growth, Zepto is well-positioned to redefine the quick-commerce landscape in India.\\\\nWhile challenges like profitability and competition remain, Zepto’s rapid rise and strategic initiatives make it a company to watch in the evolving e-commerce ecosystem.\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto, the quick commerce platform that has become synonymous with rapid delivery services, on Tuesday released its financial results for the fiscal year ending March 2024. The company reported a massive growth in revenue, clocking Rs 4,454 crore, a 2.2 times increase from Rs 2,026 crore in FY23. However, the growth came at a steep price as Zepto’s total expenditure rose to Rs 5,747 crore, reflecting a 71.6% increase from the previous year.\\\\nPC: The Financial Express\\\\nThe main revenue driver for Zepto is its network of over 550 dark stores, through which it delivers more than 25,000 products within a 10-minute time frame. The company handles more than 700,000 orders per day, proving the scale and efficiency of operations in this competitive quick commerce sector. The total operating revenue of the company was primarily generated through income from the sales of products at 89.2%, which rose by 120% to Rs 3,973 crore in FY24. The remaining revenue came from delivery, warehousing, and advertising services.\\\\nDespite the surge in revenue, Zepto faced challenges in managing its costs effectively. The cost of procurement alone accounted for 60.5% of its overall expenditure, growing 87% to Rs 3,481 crore. Employee benefits also saw a significant rise, increasing by 62% to Rs 426 crore. This figure includes Rs 74 crore attributed to Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), which are non-cash expenses.\\\\nOperational costs also increased for Zepto in areas critical to its logistics and service delivery. The company spent Rs 493 crore on warehousing and Rs 580 crore on delivery costs, which added to the overall financial burden. Information technology and advertising expenses also saw a significant increase, with IT costs increasing by 65.7% to Rs 116 crore and advertising costs by 40.3% to Rs 303 crore.\\\\nDue to these expenses, the losses of Zepto only declined marginally by 2% to Rs 1,248.6 crore from Rs 1,272 crore in FY23. The ROCE improved slightly to -119.3%, and the EBITDA margin was also showing improvement at -23.81%. The company’s expense-to-earning ratio stood at Rs 1.29, meaning that for every rupee earned, the company spent Rs 1.29.\\\\nIn terms of financial health, Zepto reported current assets of Rs 1,398 crore that included cash and bank balances of Rs 692 crore. The company has just received $350 million in a funding round led by Motilal Oswal Private Wealth, which has raised $1.85 billion for the company since its inception. Currently, with a valuation of $5 billion, Zepto retains a 29% market share in quick commerce and is the second-largest player, after Blinkit.\\\\nZepto is set to launch a standalone app for its 10-minute food delivery service, Zepto Cafe, as a direct competitor to the established players such as Swiggy and Blinkit. The CEO, Aadit Palicha, has stated that the company will be profitable by FY26 and could go public in the second half of next year.\\\\nIn summary, although the financial results of Zepto show strong revenue growth, they also indicate some of the major challenges in scaling operations in the competitive quick commerce landscape. Its strategic focus on expanding its service offerings and optimizing costs will be key as it navigates its path toward profitability.\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto Business Model | How Zepto Makes Money\\\\n🔍InsightsThe convenience of Internet food delivery services was greatly enhanced during the pandemic. The dominant player in the online grocery delivery app and company market is influencing users\\\\\\' habits.\\\\nOnline shopping is becoming increasingly common among consumers. As a result, more and more delivery services, like Zepto, have launched their services to meet the ever-increasing demands of their clients for lightning-fast delivery. You should be familiar with the Zepto business model if you are looking to enter the market.\\\\nThe supermarket delivery industry is booming, thank goodness, because it requires less time, effort, and money than other industries. In 2020, the projected value of the online grocery business was $2.9 billion. Through this article, we will go over the basics of Zepto, including its business model and how it generates revenue.\\\\nAbout Zepto\\\\nZepto, founded in 2021 by Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, two former Stanford University students, is a platform for quick commerce that provides a grocery delivery service within 10 minutes. Fast grocery delivery was the driving force for the founding of the firm. Zepto boasts delivery to major cities like Bengaluru, Lucknow, Delhi, Chennai, etc., from its Mumbai headquarters. The original company, Kiranakart Technologies Private Limited, was turned off into Zepto by its founders.\\\\nZepto Business Model\\\\nThe \"dark store model\" serves as the foundation for Zepto\\\\\\'s business model. This involves setting up delivery-only warehouse-style stores in residential regions. The shops sell a variety of products, and the sole way for buyers to place orders is through the Zepto India website or app. Across multiple regions, Zepto now has more than eighty-six dark storefronts. Dark businesses are great for quick shipping, but they may crash under heavy traffic. However, Zepto created an AI-driven system to assist with selecting, packing, and shipping to avoid sacrificing quality or service. Zepto can provide an extensive product line at rock-bottom prices because of this technology, which guarantees a seamless transition from choosing to packaging to delivery.\\\\nZepto India can provide a fast delivery service thanks to the convenience of having outlets close to customers\\\\\\' homes, which is an advantage of the Zepto business model. The elimination of the necessity for employees to utilize the store also allows the company to run with a reduced headcount.\\\\nHow Zepto Makes Money | Zepto Revenue Model\\\\nA little commission is charged for each order placed using the Zepto Grocery app in India.

We will be able to meet that,” said Thiagarajan, adding that Bluestar expects to sell approximately 1.75 million units of room ACs in FY26.\\\\nOn Thursday, Bluestar introduced 150 new models as part of its expansion strategy. A significant portion of this growth is expected to come from tier-III, IV, and V markets, as more middle-class consumers aspire to own air conditioners.\\\\n“It is actually the middle-class aspirational consumers who are beginning to buy,” said Thiagarajan. “Now it is also evident from the fact that this year, for example, Bluestar’s 40 per cent sale will be through consumer finance.”\\\\nCurrently, over 65 percent of Bluestar’s sales come from smaller towns, while demand in metro cities is also on the rise, particularly as more consumers invest in second or third air conditioners for their homes.\\\\nTo meet the growing demand, Bluestar is expanding its production capacity. “Last year, the capacity was around 1.5 million, and it will go up to 1.7 million. Still, we do buy some two lakh units from outside. So, the intention is next year, to take the capacity to 1.75 million,” said Thiagarajan.\\\\nThe Indian room AC market is estimated to have surpassed 15 million units in FY25, with an anticipated growth of 25-30 percent in the next fiscal year.\\\\nThe increasing exposure to air-conditioned environments in restaurants, metro railways, cars, airports, and offices is playing a key role in shaping consumer behavior, leading to higher demand for home ACs.\\\\n“The growth is all around and this is the only category which is growing. There are many other categories which are stagnant or not growing,” Thiagarajan explained. “Now people’s priority is to get an air conditioner. In a typical Indian home, people buy for either their parents’ comfort or children’s comfort. And so, the next 10 years, such growth should continue.”\\\\nWith a 14 percent share in India\\\\\\'s room AC market, Bluestar competes with Voltas, LG Electronics, Hitachi, Godrej Appliances, Panasonic, Haier, and others. Despite the competition, the company remains optimistic about sustained growth.\\\\nThiagarajan also emphasized that domestic value addition in AC manufacturing is set to increase, supported by the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, which is fostering a stronger component ecosystem for air conditioners in India.\\\\nPret A Manger has reached a significant global milestone with the launch of its first-ever full-service dine-in store at Phoenix Mall of the Millennium, Pune.

The move aligns with Zepto’s broader strategy to strengthen its retail presence in India before going public.\\\\nThe private equity divisions of Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. and Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd. are in talks to acquire shares in the secondary sale, according to sources familiar with the matter. Zepto itself will not raise additional capital through this transaction, but employees and some investors will have an opportunity to liquidate their holdings. The sale is expected to take place at a valuation of just over $5 billion, consistent with Zepto’s last funding round in late 2023.\\\\nZepto’s initiative aims to increase Indian investor participation, currently at 33 percent of its cap table. The company intends to raise this shareholding to around 50 percent before its IPO, which could take place later in 2024 or early 2026. Founders Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra hold about 20 percent of the company.\\\\nSecondary stock sales have often been debated, as they allow executives and employees to monetize their holdings before an IPO. However, in recent years, such transactions have been used as a tool to retain talent and provide liquidity to early investors.\\\\nOperating in India’s competitive grocery delivery market, Zepto faces competition from Amazon India, SoftBank-backed Swiggy, publicly listed Zomato, and Tata Group’s BigBasket. The company was founded in 2021 by Palicha and Vohra, who dropped out of Stanford University’s computer science program to establish the startup in India.\\\\nIndia’s direct selling industry has recorded a turnover of Rs 22,142 crore in FY 2023-24, reflecting a 4.4 percent year-on-year growth from Rs 21,282 crore in the previous fiscal. The sector continues to expand, supported by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.15 percent over the past five years, according to the Annual Survey Report released by the Indian Direct Selling Association (IDSA). The survey, conducted by IPSOS, was presented by Chirag Paswan, Union Minister for Food Processing Industry, at an event focused on the industry\\\\\\'s development.\\\\nThe report highlights the regional distribution of sales, with the northern region leading at 29.8 percent, followed by the East (24.2 percent), West (22.4 percent), South (15.3 percent), and Northeast (8.3 percent). Maharashtra accounted for the highest sales share at 13 percent, followed by West Bengal (11.3 percent), Uttar Pradesh (10 percent), Bihar (6.2 percent), and Karnataka (5.7 percent). Wellness and nutraceutical products contributed 64.15 percent of total sales, while cosmetics and personal care made up 23.75 percent, and household goods accounted for 3.1 percent. These three categories collectively represent 91 percent of total direct sales in India’s retail sector.\\\\nThe number of active direct sellers has also risen, reaching 88 lakh compared to 86 lakh in the previous year. Women now make up 44 percent of the total direct seller workforce, an increase from 37 percent in FY 2022-23, reflecting the growing presence of women entrepreneurs in the industry.\\\\nAddressing the event, Paswan acknowledged the direct selling industry’s contribution to self-employment and job creation. He emphasized the importance of product quality and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to creating a business-friendly environment. He encouraged the sector to adopt good manufacturing practices and assured stakeholders of continued support, particularly in addressing concerns related to the nutraceutical segment and improving access to business loans.\\\\nVivek Katoch, Chairperson of IDSA said, “The report showcases an encouraging trend for the direct selling industry in the country. The growth trajectory of the industry has been on a surge over the years. A CAGR of 7.15 percent is a testament to the fact that direct selling businesses in the country have made steady growth and are poised to strengthen further in the years to come on the back of a promising regulatory framework by the government for the industry.”\\\\nThe industry’s sustained expansion, coupled with regulatory support, indicates a positive outlook for direct selling in India\\\\\\'s retail sector.\\\\nRetail businesses in India\\\\\\'s liquor sector are looking to the new government in Delhi for policy changes that would create a level playing field for domestic premium liquor brands competing with imported products. Industry experts believe this could improve access to Indian-made single-malt whiskies, wines, and gins in the capital.\\\\nCurrently, the excise policy in Delhi imposes a high brand-license fee, which has kept many domestic liquor manufacturers out of the market. Industry representatives argue that revising these regulations would enable consumers to access a wider range of locally produced premium alcoholic beverages.\\\\nWith policy changes, Indian liquor brands could gain a stronger presence in Delhi\\\\\\'s retail market, allowing them to compete more effectively with global counterparts while expanding consumer choices in the capital.\\\\nRetail brand Perona, known for its modern minimalism and craftsmanship in India’s luxury fashion market, has brought on board Paul, a designer with over two decades of experience in European fashion.

Committed to reviving the legacy of Indian mithais and positioning them as a preferred dessert choice, the brand handcrafts its offerings using time-honored artisanal recipes and the finest ingredients.

The raids revealed that both companies stored, sold, and exhibited products that did not carry the mandatory BIS standard mark, a government statement confirmed.\\\\nResponding to the findings, an Amazon India spokesperson stated that the company is “engaged closely with various stakeholders, including regulators.” Similarly, a Flipkart spokesperson reiterated the company’s commitment to compliance, stating, “The platform has several processes to review the listings sellers make on the marketplace and also conducts regular audits to ensure compliance.” Flipkart also emphasized its efforts to work with sellers to raise awareness and adhere to all applicable laws.\\\\nThe BIS crackdown adds to the ongoing regulatory challenges faced by Amazon and Flipkart, both dominant players in India’s e-commerce industry. According to consultancy firm Bain & Company, India\\\\\\'s e-commerce market was valued at $57 billion to $60 billion in 2023, with projections to exceed $160 billion by 2028.\\\\nDuring the raids, officials seized 3,376 uncertified products from Amazon’s warehouse, including flasks, insulated food containers, toys, and ceiling fans.

In September 2023, an antitrust investigation found that Amazon and Flipkart had violated local competition laws by favoring select sellers on their platforms. Later in November, authorities raided several Amazon and Flipkart sellers, following a 2021 Reuters investigation that revealed Amazon had provided preferential treatment to select sellers to circumvent Indian regulations.\\\\nAmazon has denied any wrongdoing in response to these allegations.\\\\nMalabar Gold & Diamonds is set to expand its presence across India with the launch of 12 new showrooms by March 2025.

The company is focusing on product innovation and premiumisation to sustain its double-digit growth in the country, according to Jagrut Kotecha, CEO of PepsiCo India and South Asia.\\\\nWith snack consumption in India still lower than in other markets, PepsiCo aims to capitalize on increasing urbanization and rising disposable incomes.

We have been growing on Quaker double-digits. On our base oatmeal, we still lead the category. Saffola leads the category more on the flavored variety,\" Kotecha said.\\\\nPepsiCo continues to customize products based on regional preferences. \"The masala profile which we have on Lays in Northern India is slightly different from the Western India, which is slightly on the sweeter side. And when you go to the southern part of India, it\\\\\\'s very spicy,\" Kotecha explained. Even the cooking oil used in Kurkure varies by region, with a mustard-based profile in the East and sesame oil in the South.\\\\nThe company is also focusing on local sourcing, working with 27,000 potato farmers in India and procuring over 400,000 tons of chip-grade potatoes from states like Punjab, Gujarat, West Bengal, and Madhya Pradesh, with Assam now being added.

This growth will be fueled by product category expansion and increased market penetration.\\\\nTo support this expansion, the home appliances manufacturer has allocated over Rs. 1,000 crore between 2024 and 2028 for setting up new air-conditioner production and injection molding units. This investment follows the Rs. 2,400 crore already infused into its Pune and Greater Noida plants.\\\\nWith the establishment of the new plant, Haier India’s production capacity will rise from 1.5 million units to 4 million units annually, significantly enhancing domestic value addition.\\\\n“Currently we have a capacity of 1.5 million. However, the way the AC market is growing here, by 2027 we will have a shortage in capacity. … The new plant will be 2.5 million units,” stated NS Satish, President, Haier Appliances India.\\\\nThe company is also considering setting up a manufacturing facility in South India, with investment details to be announced soon. While specifics were not disclosed, Satish indicated that the investment would be comparable in scale and capacity to the Noida Industrial Park facility.\\\\nIn 2024, Haier reported a 36 percent increase in revenue, reaching approximately Rs. 8,900 crore and surpassing the USD 1 billion sales milestone. For the current year, the company anticipates revenue exceeding Rs. 11,500 crore.\\\\n“And subsequent to that, every year, we are looking around Rs 2,000 to 2,500 crore plus. So we have big plans. And we see a big opportunity in India. When you see the economy GDP, which is doing very well, next is the penetration of the product, which is very low when we compare it to our global counterparts,” Satish further added.\\\\nWhen asked about the timeline for achieving USD 2 billion in sales, Satish responded, “In the next three to four years, definitely. We are already a USD 1 billion company. I think in the next three to four years, we will definitely surpass USD 2 billion.”\\\\nHaier sees significant potential in product categories such as air-conditioners, refrigerators, washing machines, TV panels, and commercial freezers, given the lower market penetration in India compared to other nations. India is currently the fourth-largest market for the China-based Haier Group Corporation. However, Satish envisions India securing a place among Haier’s top three markets globally within the next four to five years, contributing USD 2 billion in revenue. At present, China, North America, and a combined Russia-Europe market lead Haier Group’s global sales.\\\\n“India has two sides of the story. One is looking for more and more premium products, and the ones who are looking for a value for money product. That’s where we manufacture even a single-door refrigerator. And also, recently, we have introduced the four-door, the most premium refrigerators in India, even the air conditioner. So we see opportunity on both sides, in the entry as well as in the premium segment also,” explained Satish.\\\\nDespite this balanced approach, Haier’s primary growth in the past year has been driven by the premium category. Various affordability-enhancing schemes, such as easy EMI options, have contributed to this trend.\\\\nWhen asked if Haier plans to introduce its global brands in India’s growing premium market, Satish clarified, “We still have a huge scope for developing Haier products at this point. We will continue to invest in building the Haier brand and expanding our product portfolio. At this point, we have not thought about bringing in any global brands.”\\\\nHaier Group’s portfolio includes well-known brands such as Haier, Casarte, Leader, GE Appliances, Fisher & Paykel, AQUA, and Candy.\\\\nSwiss premium coffee brand Nespresso has made its official entry into the Indian retail market with the launch of its first boutique at Nexus Select Citywalk in Saket, Delhi.

The company’s expansion into India reflects its long-term vision to cater to a growing base of coffee aficionados, further strengthening its presence in the global market.\\\\nPepsiCo has set an ambitious target to double its revenue in India within the next five years, identifying the country as a crucial growth market. The company is making significant investments to expand its capacity and strengthen its presence in India, according to Jagrut Kotecha, CEO of PepsiCo India & South Asia.\\\\nIndia plays a key role in PepsiCo’s global revenue strategy, ranking among the company’s top three markets for food, snacks, and beverages. PepsiCo has already established greenfield plants in Uttar Pradesh and Assam to keep up with growing demand. The company plans to continue investing heavily and is set to open two more facilities, including one in southern India.\\\\n“We believe India will be the engine of growth for PepsiCo to drive the top line. Yes, it’s not as big as North America because it is a lot more evolved category. Our per capita consumption in India is still very low, not only for us on beverage and food, but we would expect one of PepsiCo’s fastest growing economies to do that,” stated Kotecha, CEO, PepsiCo India.\\\\nThe company considers India to be one of its 13 to 15 key anchor markets for global expansion, citing the country’s economic stability and growth potential. Kotecha emphasized that PepsiCo aligns with India’s vision for economic development by 2030, describing it as one of the most stable economies with strong growth fundamentals.\\\\n“It’s one of the most stable economies, growth engine, etc, and hence, PepsiCo also has been in this country for almost 30 years, good, strong, fundamentals. So, we need to double that, dial that up and start investing. We have been investing, but continue to aggressively invest to ensure that we also take that opportunity,” added Kotecha.\\\\nPepsiCo recently reported robust double-digit organic revenue growth in India, with increased market share in both the savory snacks and beverage segments. While Kotecha did not disclose a specific timeline for achieving the USD 2 billion revenue milestone, he reiterated the company’s aspiration to reach that figure.\\\\nIn 2023, PepsiCo reported revenue of approximately Rs 5,950 crore for a nine-month period due to a financial year transition.

Its bottling partner, Varun Beverages, which accounts for 90 percent of PepsiCo India’s beverage sales volume, reported standalone revenue of Rs 12,778.96 crore in 2023.\\\\nOver the past three years, PepsiCo has invested close to Rs 3,500-4,000 crore in India, reinforcing its long-term commitment to the market. Its bottling partner, Varun Beverages Ltd (VBL), has also been making significant investments, operating 41 plants and expanding capacity by 25 percent this year.\\\\nRegarding market competition, Kotecha welcomed the entry of new players like Reliance’s Campa Cola, which has disrupted the market with aggressive pricing and distributor margins.\\\\nIn 2023, approximately 80 percent of PepsiCo India’s revenue came from its food division, with the remaining 20 percent from beverages. The Indian beverage market, valued at around USD 12 billion, is currently growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10-11 percent.\\\\nWith strong financial growth, ongoing market expansion, and continued investments, PepsiCo remains dedicated to strengthening its position in India and capitalizing on the country’s economic potential.\\\\nDavaindia, one of India’s leading generic medicine retail chains, has unveiled its strategic plans to widen its reach across Kerala, ensuring healthcare remains both accessible and affordable.

Leveraging its established presence in the gold industry, the company aims to address the growing demand for ethical and sustainable diamonds.\\\\nLab-grown diamonds are gaining traction as an alternative to mined diamonds, with the global market projected to reach $1.2 billion by 2033. In India, the industry lacks established players, creating an opportunity for Augmont to expand its offerings.\\\\nKetan Kothari, Director, Augmont said, \"Augmont\\\\\\'s vision is very clear - we want to be the leading lab-grown diamond jewellery brand in India. LGD is the future for a nation like India where jewellery has many meanings - aspirations, emotions, and culture. The penetration of mined diamond jewelry in India is less than 5 percent whereas 95 percent of consumers want to own diamonds. Mined diamonds have given negative returns and hence they are not an investment for Indian consumers, who are the smartest when it comes to value investments. Large jewellery chains are in a dilemma to enter this space because of the fact that they have been selling mined diamond jewelry for years and it will be a hard sell for the consumers. Other brands that have entered the space are largely start-ups which have to build trust and credibility which takes years. Augmont\\\\\\'s foray into jewellery could not be better timed. Customers trust us for the transparency, innovation, and the fact that we always offer buyback for all our gold products and now LGD jewelry too!\"\\\\nAugmont plans to introduce Akoirah with a focus on pricing, design, and trust. \"The math is simple - whatever money that you save in terms of the difference between mined diamonds and LGDs, invest the same in gold. The appreciation in gold prices will more than make up for the investments in LGD even if for argument\\\\\\'s sake, LGD prices don\\\\\\'t increase! Added to that, you get better designs and quality. We are bringing the same commitment to purity, value, and excellence that has defined Augmont’s gold legacy into the world of fine diamond jewellery,\" added Ketan Kothari.\\\\nNamita Kothari, Founder of Akoirah added, \"Akoirah is all about making Love-Grown Diamonds attainable for all. We believe that fine jewellery should be both aspirational and accessible. Through innovative craftsmanship, and unbeatable gold rates, we are crafting jewellery that is not just beautiful, but meaningful.\"\\\\nAugmont aims to integrate its expertise in gold pricing, purity, and recycling into the LGD segment. Akoirah will feature 100 percent recycled gold and responsibly sourced lab-grown diamonds, ensuring sustainability without compromising on quality. The company also plans to use advanced technology to provide certified, high-quality diamonds at competitive prices. Additionally, customers will be offered a 100 percent exchange and buyback value.\\\\nThe expansion strategy includes an omni-channel approach, leveraging Augmont’s existing digital gold consumer base. With prices starting at Rs 5,000, Akoirah aims to cater to a broad audience. The company plans to establish 100 stores across India, providing both online and offline retail access.\\\\nThrough Akoirah, Augmont is positioning itself as a key player in the evolving jewellery market, aligning with the increasing demand for ethical and sustainable diamond options in India.\\\\nVivienne Westwood is set to present its first-ever fashion show in India, showcasing a collection at Mumbai’s Gateway of India.

Indian artisans have employed traditional and sustainable techniques to create these textiles.\\\\nKhadi, derived from the term \"Khaddar,\" is known for its handmade, coarse texture and its adaptability to different climates.

The announcement led to a 14 percent drop in its shares.\\\\nThe apparel retailer warned that profit margins would be under pressure due to higher freight costs and increased promotional activities early in the year to clear surplus inventory. Additionally, the company highlighted a $5 million impact from U.S. tariffs, adding another challenge to its financial outlook.\\\\nCEO Fran Horowitz addressed the shift in consumer spending patterns during a post-earnings call, stating that spring demand had returned to a \"more normalized\" pace this year. She noted a decline in sales for the A&F brand, mirroring Target’s (TGT.N) concerns over weak apparel sales in February.\\\\nWilliam Blair, analyst, Dylan Carden weighed in on the earnings report, expressing concern over the company\\\\\\'s performance, saying, \"The initial print does not sow confidence.\" He further cautioned that while A&F brand sales had grown by 2 percent during the holiday quarter, they could be on a downward trajectory, potentially jeopardizing Abercrombie\\\\\\'s full-year targets.\\\\nAbercrombie & Fitch has projected annual net sales growth between 3 percent and 5 percent, falling short of market expectations, which had anticipated a 6.77 percent increase, according to LSEG data.\\\\nAcross the retail industry, major players like Walmart (WMT.N) and Home Depot (HD.N) have set their annual targets conservatively, as persistent inflation pressures American consumers to cut back on discretionary spending, including apparel, home furnishings, and electronics. Adding to the uncertainty is the potential economic fallout from tariffs on imported goods, a policy concern that continues to weigh on shoppers\\\\\\' confidence.\\\\nFor fiscal 2025, Abercrombie expects an operating margin between 14 percent and 15 percent, factoring in the impact of tariffs on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico. This marks a slight dip from the 15 percent margin recorded in the previous fiscal year. The company sources 5 percent to 6 percent of its merchandise from China, while its exposure to Mexican imports remains \"immaterial,\" according to executives.\\\\nAbercrombie\\\\\\'s 2023 annual report reveals that the company imports 34 percent of its products from Vietnam, with Cambodia and India among its top sourcing regions.\\\\nDespite the cautious outlook, holiday quarter results surpassed expectations. The company reported $1.58 billion in net sales, driven by a 16 percent sales increase in its teen-focused Hollister brand. Adjusted earnings per share stood at $3.57, slightly exceeding analyst estimates of $3.54. For the full year, Abercrombie projects earnings between $10.40 and $11.40 per share, marginally above market forecasts.\\\\nCopyright © 2009 - 2025 Franchiseindia.com Ltd\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto, the quick-commerce unicorn revolutionizing 10-minute deliveries in India, has reported a remarkable 120% jump in its revenue for FY24, reaching ₹4,455 crore. This significant growth underscores the rising preference of customers for quick deliveries over traditional e-commerce platforms and kirana stores. Despite increased operational costs, Zepto managed to reduce its losses marginally by 2%, signaling a strong trajectory toward profitability.\\\\nRevenue Boom Outpaces Competitors\\\\nZepto has cemented its leadership in the quick commerce segment with a revenue far ahead of its competitors. In FY24:\\\\n– Zepto: ₹4,455 crore\\\\n– Blinkit (market leader): ₹2,301 crore\\\\n– Swiggy Instamart: ₹1,100 crore\\\\nZepto’s dominance in revenue terms highlights its ability to capture a growing customer base transitioning to faster delivery options. CEO and co-founder Aadit Palicha emphasized the company’s robust growth on LinkedIn, stating, “Our accounting revenue has grown 120% year-on-year… Even with 120% growth, our absolute losses came down year-on-year with PAT as a percentage of revenue improving from -63% in FY23 to -28% in FY24.”\\\\nRising Costs and Controlled Losses\\\\nZepto’s phenomenal growth has come at a price. The company’s total expenses surged by 72% to ₹5,747 crore in FY24, up from ₹3,350 crore in FY23. This sharp increase is attributed to high marketing expenses, the cost of materials, and investments in logistics and operations to support its aggressive expansion.\\\\nDespite these expenses, Zepto managed to reduce its losses marginally from ₹1,272 crore in FY23 to ₹1,249 crore in FY24. The improvement in PAT (profit after tax) as a percentage of revenue—from -63% in FY23 to -28% in FY24—signals better financial discipline and operational efficiencies.\\\\nBusiness Model and Operations\\\\nZepto operates through Kiranakart Technologies Pvt Ltd, its Indian entity responsible for:\\\\n– Licensing the Zepto brand.\\\\n– Trading consumer goods.\\\\n– Providing logistics services.\\\\n– Running advertisements on the Zepto app.\\\\nKiranakart acts as a B2B (business-to-business) platform, supplying goods to various entities operating under the Zepto umbrella. This integrated structure enables Zepto to scale operations rapidly while maintaining centralized control over the supply chain.\\\\nFunding and Expansion\\\\nZepto has raised an astounding ₹11,475 crore ($1.35 billion) in back-to-back funding rounds over just five months, bolstering its financial position. As of FY24, the company reported a cash and bank balance of ₹692 crore, but the recent funding injections have significantly strengthened its balance sheet.\\\\nThis capital influx is essential to sustain Zepto’s monthly cash burn rate of ₹250–₹300 crore, which translates to roughly ₹10 crore per day. The funding supports:\\\\n– Expansion of operations.\\\\n– Setting up new dark stores to enhance delivery speed.\\\\n– Positioning the company for future growth amid rising competition.\\\\nIPO Plans and Domestic Base Flip\\\\nZepto is gearing up for an ambitious $500 million Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2025. To align with its public market aspirations, the company is preparing to shift its base from Singapore to India. It has already appointed Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Axis Capital to lead the IPO process.\\\\nThis move reflects Zepto’s commitment to strengthening its domestic presence and tapping into the growing Indian stock market.\\\\nZepto operates in a fiercely competitive quick commerce market, vying against:\\\\n– Blinkit (market leader).\\\\n– Swiggy Instamart.\\\\n– Established players like Flipkart Minutes and Tata BigBasket.\\\\n– Potential entrants like Amazon.\\\\nWhile Blinkit holds a dominant position in terms of market share, Zepto’s higher revenue highlights its capability to outpace competitors in value terms. However, sustaining this momentum requires balancing rapid growth with cost management.\\\\nZepto’s focus remains on operational efficiency, market expansion, and transitioning toward profitability. The company’s leadership is confident about achieving PAT profitability soon, driven by improved revenue and disciplined cost control.\\\\nAdditionally, its plans to go public and increase its domestic footprint could unlock new growth opportunities while reducing reliance on external funding.\\\\nZepto’s FY24 performance showcases its potential to transform India’s quick commerce sector. With a revenue of ₹4,455 crore, reduced losses, and strong investor backing, the company is well-positioned for sustained growth.\\\\nAs it navigates challenges from competitors and prepares for a landmark IPO, Zepto’s aggressive expansion strategy and customer-centric model make it a frontrunner in shaping the future of quick commerce in India.\\\\n                \\\\n                \\')], _name=None, _meta={})]}', origin=ToolCall(tool_name='webSearch', arguments={'query': 'Zepto growth drivers and profitability focus'}, id=None), error=False)], _name=None, _meta={}),\n",

This innovative approach, where groceries and essential items are delivered in under 10 minutes, began as a novel concept but has rapidly evolved into a substantial business model. Central to this growth is the Zepto business model and digital marketing strategy, which has played a vital role in building the brand and driving customer engagement.\\\\nIt’s true – Companies like Zepto are at the forefront of this revolution, with even major corporations like Reliance recognising the potential and getting involved. However, despite its rapid expansion, the quick commerce industry faces considerable challenges, especially in terms of profitability.\\\\nThis article delves into how companies like Zepto are striving for success, the obstacles they encounter, and what the future might hold.\\\\nBut before we get into it, a quick side note – If you’re the kind of person who loves decoding marketing strategies, exploring digital marketing masters courses or enrolling in an online digital marketing course can provide valuable insights into this dynamic field.\\\\nLearn Digital Marketing for FREE\\\\n- 45 Mins Masterclass\\\\n- Watch Anytime, Anywhere\\\\n- 1,00,000+ Students Enrolled\\\\nSo, What is Quick Commerce?\\\\nQuick commerce, or Q-commerce, revolves around delivering products like groceries at lightning speed—typically within 30 minutes. The success of this model hinges on dark stores which are small warehouses strategically located close to customers. These warehouses typically store popular items that can be dispatched rapidly.\\\\nFor example, when you order everyday essentials like bread, eggs, and milk, a nearby dark store can have these items packed and en route to you within minutes. This sets quick commerce apart from traditional online shopping, where products may take days to arrive as they are shipped from distant warehouses.\\\\nThe business model of Zepto heavily depends on this approach, with dark stores being crucial for ensuring fast delivery times. This quick turnaround is a fundamental aspect of the Zepto grocery business model, which prioritises speed and convenience to attract customers.\\\\nIf you’re interested in how business models are developed, consider reading our digital marketing blogs and digital marketing case studies.\\\\nHow Dark Stores Work\\\\nDark stores serve as the foundation of quick commerce, enabling the rapid delivery of products. Unlike traditional grocery stores that serve walk-in customers, dark stores are dedicated exclusively to fulfilling online orders.\\\\nTypically located within 1.5 to 4 kilometres of the customers they serve, these stores are optimised for fast, efficient service.\\\\nFor instance, if you live in a bustling neighbourhood, there’s likely a dark store nearby stocked with everyday items. Once you place an order, the products are quickly picked, packed, and dispatched—often within minutes. This process is streamlined by advanced technology that assists workers in these stores to complete orders efficiently.\\\\nThe Zepto business model pdf available online provides a comprehensive overview of how these dark stores operate and how they contribute to the overall efficiency of the business. Understanding the Zepto business model is essential for anyone looking to explore the quick commerce sector.\\\\nP.S. Want to become a digital marketer or work in e-commerce? Enrolling in digital marketing classes or one of the best online marketing courses can equip you with the necessary skills to succeed in this fast-paced industry.\\\\nMaking Quick Commerce Profitable\\\\nRunning a dark store is not without its costs. Setting up such a store can range from ₹25 to ₹40 lakh, with each store requiring a staff of around 13 to 14 employees. In this industry, the average order value is between ₹350 and ₹400, with gross profit margins typically ranging from 15% to 20%.\\\\nHowever, achieving profitability is challenging. Gross profit represents the revenue generated before accounting for expenses like rent, salaries, and delivery costs.\\\\nFor instance, if the delivery cost of an order is ₹40 and the gross profit is ₹80, the net profit is only ₹40. This underscores the importance of careful cost management in the quick commerce industry.\\\\nThis meticulous approach to managing costs and operations is a cornerstone of the Zepto revenue model, which has enabled the company to scale rapidly in a competitive market. The efficiency of the Zepeto business model (often misspelt as “Zepeto”) is what distinguishes it from traditional retail models.\\\\nFun fact: If you’re aiming to build a profitable business, studying various business models, especially those regarded as the most profitable business in India, can offer valuable insights. Zepto’s success story provides a blueprint for what works in the Indian market.\\\\nThe Challenges of Quick Commerce\\\\n1) Balancing Costs and Profits\\\\nOne of the primary challenges facing quick commerce companies is maintaining sufficient profit margins. Even major players like D-Mart report profit margins of only around 16%.\\\\nFor companies like Zepto, which incur additional costs for rapid deliveries, achieving and maintaining profitable margins is particularly challenging.\\\\nConducting a Zepto SWOT analysis is crucial for understanding the company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and potential risks. This analysis can reveal areas where the company excels and where it may need to improve.\\\\nFor instance, a Zepto SWOT analysis might highlight the company’s proficiency in fast delivery while also identifying challenges related to customer acquisition costs.\\\\n2) Competing with Local Stores\\\\nMany consumers have a local store within walking distance that offers free delivery. If quick commerce companies cannot deliver quickly or fail to maintain product freshness, customers may prefer to shop locally.\\\\nFor example, if Zepto takes more than 30 minutes to deliver groceries, a customer might opt to visit the nearby store instead. This competition from local stores is a significant challenge for quick commerce companies.\\\\nHowever, the Zepto marketing strategy has been instrumental in overcoming this challenge. By emphasising the convenience and speed of their services, the Zepto marketing campaign has successfully drawn in a large customer base.\\\\nThe effectiveness of the Zepto digital marketing strategy has been crucial in retaining customer loyalty despite stiff competition.\\\\nIf you’re looking to explore digital marketing in greater detail, consider taking digital marketing courses in Mumbai or digital marketing courses in Faridabad. Both cities offer highly regarded courses in this field.\\\\nAlternatively, digital marketing courses in Thrissur are also an excellent choice if you’re based in southern India.\\\\n3) Customer Habits and Order Size\\\\nQuick commerce apps are frequently used for small, spontaneous purchases. For example, someone making a sandwich might order just bread, cheese, and tomatoes. These small orders make it challenging for companies to turn a profit. If companies try to impose a minimum order value, they risk diminishing the convenience factor that attracts users to quick commerce in the first place.\\\\nTo address this, the Zepto promotion strategy often includes discounts and special offers that encourage customers to add additional items to their carts, thus boosting the average order value. This strategy is a key part of the Zepto business plan aimed at boosting profitability.\\\\nUnderstanding consumer behaviour and the role of AI in this process is becoming increasingly important. Exploring the role of AI in content creation can offer insights into how companies like Zepto can personalise marketing strategies to better meet customer needs.\\\\n4) New Competitors\\\\nNew apps are emerging that offer similar services by connecting customers directly with local stores. For instance, ‘My Kirana’ in Pune allows customers to order from their local kirana stores via an app, ensuring fast delivery without the need to use Zepto. These apps pose a potential threat by taking away customers from established quick commerce platforms.\\\\nThe Future of Quick Commerce\\\\nOpportunities and Risks\\\\nThe quick commerce industry holds great promise but also faces significant challenges. Companies that can effectively address these challenges—by controlling delivery costs, increasing order sizes, and competing with local stores—are poised to become major players in the retail industry.\\\\nThe long-term success of Zepto will depend on its ability to adapt and refine its strategies. As the market continues to evolve, the business model of Zepto must remain flexible to respond to new opportunities and challenges.\\\\nCould Big Companies Take Over?\\\\nThere is also the possibility that large corporations like Reliance or D-Mart might acquire quick commerce companies like Zepto. These giants have the resources and supply chains to run such services more efficiently. For instance, if Reliance were to acquire Zepto, it could leverage Zepto’s delivery network to distribute its own products faster and at a lower cost.\\\\nShould such an acquisition occur, the Zepto marketing strategy would likely be significantly enhanced, integrating seamlessly with the extensive resources of a company like Reliance. This could potentially revolutionise the way quick commerce operates.\\\\nFor those interested in understanding how such market shifts could play out, attending afree LinkedIn essentials masterclass or exploring a free top paying skills course could provide valuable insights.\\\\nWant to Know Why 2,50,000+ Students Trust Us?\\\\nDive into the numbers that make us the #1 choice for career success\\\\nCourses Recommended for you\\\\nAditya Shastri leads the Business Development segment at IIDE and is a seasoned Content Marketing expert.

It promises to deliver groceries to your doorsteps within 10 minutes. Other companies offer delivery within 30 minutes. But Zepto delivers the daily essentials within 10 minutes. The business model of Zepto involves its business plan, revenue model, competitors, SWOT Analysis, and many more.\\\\nZepto’s business model was developed by a couple of successful instant grocery delivery startup founders. The company was founded by two teenagers Aadit Palecha and his childhood buddy Kaivalya Vohra. The Zepto business model works within the quick commerce segment in India.\\\\nBusiness Plan\\\\nThe Zepto business model promises to deliver your grocery in 10 minutes. Zepto’s network of “cloud shops” or “micro-warehouses” allows the company to fill orders quickly and efficiently. Zepto business model is based on the “dark store model.” This involves setting up warehouse-style stores in residential areas that are only accessible to delivery drivers. The stores contain a range of products, and customers can only order via the Zepto India app or website. Zepto currently has over 86+ dark stores in various locations. While dark stores are designed for instant deliveries, they can’t always handle high sales volume.\\\\nZepto has places called dark stores or micro fulfillment centers that lie in higher-demand neighborhoods. These dark stores use technology for performing tasks such as the placement of products. Some other tasks they perform include deciding the store locations, and mapping delivery routes for avoiding heavy traffic congestions. The company is already delivering items that include cooking necessities, fresh produce, personal care items, snacks and beverages, and home cleaning items.\\\\n- Faster delivery and enhanced distribution\\\\n- Raise customer reach\\\\n- Contactless shopping\\\\n- Enhanced Product Assortment and Inventory\\\\nThese facilities, which allow the company to fulfill its ten-minute promise on up to 90% of orders, possess the following characteristics:\\\\n- They are not open to the public.\\\\n- They are located in high-demand neighborhoods.\\\\n- They stock only the most commonly ordered items.\\\\n- They are ergonomically designed to ensure order packers can move as swiftly and efficiently as possible.\\\\nRevenue Model\\\\nZepto makes money by charging a commission fee from the grocery stores for every order placed through the app. Additionally, Zepto may charge a delivery fee from the customers for the delivery service.\\\\nMargins on each individual product\\\\nHandling Charges\\\\nProduct Customizations\\\\nProduct Ads\\\\nMembership\\\\nBy subscribing to their membership, you can get\\\\n- Free deliveries on all orders\\\\n- No surge fees\\\\n- Better discounts\\\\nCompetitors\\\\nSWOT Analysis\\\\nStrengths\\\\n• Excellent usage of technology: With the assistance of www.locus.sh Zepto records its customers’ geographical data, traffic dynamics, delivery time, and so on. They gather and evaluate this data to determine whether more dark establishments are needed in the region to meet the 10-minute objective.\\\\n• Competent Workforce: The effective management of Zepto is in the hands of highly skilled and experienced professionals. They are Zepto’ s most valuable resource since they are well informed about the market. Palicha and Vohra, the co-founders, did a fantastic job in creating their team.\\\\n• Strong financial support: Zepto is well-funded, which allows it to expand and grow into a market leader. They currently have a total funding of $360 million.\\\\n• Being true to their objective: Zepto ensures that their customers’ expectations are met by delivering goods in 10 minutes. Zepto achieves their aim 90% of the time, which contributes to brand loyalty.\\\\nWeakness\\\\n• Net Income: Zepto’s operational costs are high. They need to grow their sales while decreasing some of their expenditures to make their business profitable.\\\\n• Reliance on retailers: Zepto’s business strategy is primarily dependent on other businesses and their inventory. When a retailer’s stock is unavailable, customers may be forced to select a higher-priced substitution or go without buying that item from them.\\\\n• Nothing Unique: Zepto’s business strategy is not very unique, and any company may enter this market and replicate it.\\\\n• Fluctuating customer base: To keep their clientele, Zepto must find a balance between their discount strategy and keeping their delivery time under 10 minutes.\\\\nOpportunity\\\\n• Infiltrating further into existing locations and entering fresh cities: One way they can outperform their competitors is to grow their business as quickly as possible.\\\\n• Various Business Ventures: Zepto has developed a brand identity for itself, which they can now utilize to enter into other sectors and diversify their revenue stream.\\\\nThreats\\\\n- Heavy competition: Zepto is in a league with big names. Customers swing from one app to the next like a pendulum. Because there is little consumer loyalty, Zepto must continually stay on top of their game.\\\\n- Exploitation of delivery boys: There are several sceptics of the quick commerce industry. Delivery boys are exploited in the name of quick delivery and are subjected to extreme strain, increasing the likelihood of an accident.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nZepto is a detail-oriented and intense business with strong technical and operating discipline that allows them to pull off the 10-minute delivery. Zepto is looking to offer its service to more countries. This company is planning to cover about 100 pin codes. The fastest delivery is a fresh idea. The delivery platform brings fast delivery to customers through the dark store concept.\\\\n                \\\\n                None\\\\n                \\\\n                International Journal of Advanced Research in Commerce, Management &Social Science (IJARCMSS) 193 \\\\nISSN :2581-7930,  Impact Factor : 6.809, Volume 05, No. 04(II), October-December,  2022, pp 193-196 \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\nJUST IN 10 MINUTES: A CASE STUDY ON ZEPTO \\\\n \\\\n Dr. Sunita Gupta\\\\uf02a \\\\nAvani Pandey** \\\\nABSTRACT \\\\n \\\\nThis case discusses the working of Zepto , an e -commerce company founded in April 2021 in \\\\nBandra, Mumbai by two 19 -year-old Stanford dropouts Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra.  Well, they are \\\\nnot newbies in the start -up world, this is their third start -up after GoPool and Kiranakart.  They came with \\\\nthis ground-breaking idea while sitting in their homes and waiting for their groceries to be delivered in 2 -3 \\\\ndays. Zepto belongs to those start -up subgroups that experienced meteoric development in the post -\\\\nCovid period. This case explains the developme nt process of how the company is making it possible to \\\\ndeliver items in 10 minutes. Zepto has raised $360 million in funding with the lead investors being the \\\\nAmerican start up accelerator company Y Combinator and the American growth equity firm Glade Broo k \\\\nCapital Partners. Currently, the company has a valuation of $900 million. 1 So, the possibility that Zepto  \\\\nwill soon turn into a unicorn is not a daft idea. However, there is a major concern surrounding Zepto’ s \\\\nbusiness model as they have still not made the business profitable. Zepto is also facing tough \\\\ncompetition from its rival Blinkit (formerly known as Grofers) who was founded in December 2013. \\\\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\\\n \\\\nKeywords: Zepto, Start-up, E-commerce, Business Model, Post-Covid. \\\\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\\\n \\\\nIntroduction \\\\n Zepto is a quick e-commerce company that started its operations in 2021. \\\\n The company started its operations in Bandra, Mumbai and has subsequently extended its \\\\ndelivery areas to Pune, Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Ghaziabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata. \\\\n On October 31, 2021, a total of 8 investors, led by Glade Brook Capital Partners, invested in \\\\nthem $60 million after which more investors began to notice them. Later, they raised additional funding \\\\nthrough their series C and series D rounds. Y Combinator Continuity Fund became the major investor in \\\\nboth of these rounds. \\\\n The Series C and D rounds were held on December 20, 2021 and May 2, 2022 and raised $100 \\\\nmillion and $200 million respectively2.But Zepto is not the only quick commerce start-up that is backed by \\\\nstrong funding, it is up against fierce competition in India from Blinkit. Blinkit has received backing from \\\\n24 investor s and has gone through a total of 19 fundraising rounds. Blinkit is currently valued at $1 \\\\nbillion3. And then there is also Dunzo which is backed by Google. \\\\nZepto’ s tagline is \"Groceries delivered in 10 minutes”. They do this with the help of Dark stores . \\\\nThey are nothing but warehouses that are not open to the public and are located in such area in the \\\\nneighbourhood where demand is high.Only commonly requested commodities are kept in these \\\\nwarehouses, preventing the loss of unsold stock. Zepto’ s dark st ores are designed in a way so that \\\\norders are filled as rapidly as possible, effectively and efficiently reducing time. Currently, Zepto is \\\\ndelivering 2500+ goods, including food and drink, personal care products, fresh produce, home cleaning \\\\nsupplies, and  snacks and beverages, from its 100+ dark stores. As stated by the CEO of zepto  Aadit \\\\nPalicha the average delivery time taken by Zepto is 8 minutes and 47 seconds. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf02a Supervisor, Mentor &Associate Professor, Department of Commerce, Daulat Ram College, University of \\\\nDelhi, Delhi, India. \\\\n**  Student pursuing B.

The company uses artificial intelligence (AI) t o \\\\nenhance the effectiveness of its delivery network by taking into account variables like weather, traffic \\\\npatterns, population, geography, and the availability of last-mile supplies. \\\\n The co-founders have managed to make the roots of the company strong by  getting the best \\\\ntalent out there to work for them when they first started building a team.  They were successful in \\\\npersuading a number of high-profile executives from Dream 11, Amazon, Uber, Pharmeasy, and Flipkart. \\\\n(Source: LinkedIn) \\\\nThese qualified exe cutives have assisted Zepto in achieving unit economics and capital \\\\nefficiency. They are what have allowed Zepto to carve out a place for itself in the grocery’s delivery \\\\nmarket. \\\\nFindings  \\\\nGroceries account for the majority of India\\\\\\'s $1 trillion retail market.1 Consequently, this market \\\\nhas enormous potential. During Corona, it was challenging to leave the house every time you wanted to \\\\nbuy a small essential item, and today with people having to work for long hours, especially in urban cities, \\\\nit is challenging to go out and shop for daily groceries. The market needed an app like Zepto more than it \\\\nwanted one, thus its release was ideal. These apps help customers to save their time  and make their life \\\\neasier. As of right now, as mentioned by the C EO of zepto, they receive 100,000 orders each day, and \\\\ntheir demand curve is essentially flat. They once more turn to technology to determine the ideal location \\\\nfor their tiny fulfilment centres. \\\\nAlthough some would believe that Zepto’ s delivery speed is what sets them apart from the \\\\ncompetition, this is not the case. The key element that sets zepto apart from its rivals is not the quickness \\\\nof the delivery men, but rather how effectively it uses technology. Zepto tracks its customers\\\\\\' spatial data, \\\\ntraffic dynamics, the time it takes to deliver the items, etc. with the aid of www.locus.sh. They collect this \\\\ndata and analyse it to decide whether they need more dark stores in the area to be able to achieve that \\\\n10-minute goal. \\\\nZepto Generates Income in Two Ways \\\\n• It first negotiates a profit margin with the companies based on how much of their product is kept \\\\nin the warehouse. \\\\n• Second, they make money by charging companies for ad space and the top search results. \\\\n• Zepto had total revenue of INR 142.3 Cr in FY22, while incurring costs of INR 532.7 Cr. They \\\\nsuffered a loss of 390.3 Cr INR as a result. \\\\nMarketing costs make up the majority of their spending \\\\nThey invest a lot of money in promoting and advertising their app. During FY22, they spent INR \\\\n175.5 Cr, or almo st 33% of their overall expenses on marketing. In addition to this, the firm spent INR \\\\n213.2 Cr on stock -in-trade purchases in FY22. Employee benefits cost INR 50.3 Cr, while supply chain \\\\ncosts were INR 74 Cr.2 \\\\nZepto’ s EBITDA margin in FY22 was -259.39%.3An EBITDA offers a clear picture of the \\\\ncompany\\\\\\'s worth and displays it to potential buyers and investors. Unfortunately, Zepto’ s EBITDA is \\\\nnegative. \\\\n To distribute the products, Zepto utilizes gig workers. These individuals make an average \\\\nincome of INR 1,30,211.4 \\\\n Zepto has been able to outperform the competition because of its business model. They have a \\\\nhighly effective distribution system, and Zepto’ s AI-powered tools make it simple to manage and keep an \\\\neye on inventory and product selection. This leads to better in ventory management and a wider range of \\\\nproducts. Additionally, they have a large consumer base that is constantly growing. \\\\n \\\\n1  https://www.statista.com/statistics/1021352/india-organized-retail-market-value/https://www.statista.com/topics/5615/food-retail-in \\\\nindia/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20the%20food%20and%20grocery,retail%20market%20at%2063%20percent . \\\\n2  https://www.vccircle.com/zeptounlikely-to-turn-profitable-in-near-term \\\\n3  https://inc42.com/buzz/zepto-incurs-inr-390-cr-loss-in-first-year-of-operations-fy22-sales-at-inr-\\\\n141r/#:~:text=Zepto%2C%20which%20began%20operations%20in,stood%20at%20INR%20140.7%20Cr . \\\\n4  https://www.ambitionbox.com/salaries/zepto-salaries/delivery-boy \\\\x0cDr. Sunita Gupta & Avani Pandey: Just in 10 Minutes: A Case Study on Zepto 195 \\\\nDiscussion \\\\n Zepto is indeed facing losses but it is only natural for a fledgling enterprise in their early years of \\\\noperations to incur some loss.  While Zepto has suffered losses, it is still in a better situation than Blinkit \\\\nand Dunzo, which have suffered losses of INR 1,019 Cr and INR 464 Cr respectively.1 \\\\nThe quick commerce industry has a customer base that is not very devoted, s o even if delivery \\\\ntime increases by a few minutes, customers will still go where they can obtain the best deals. \\\\n Zepto has to strike a balance between discounts and deals and keep their delivery time between \\\\n10 and 20 minutes. Blinkit is their sole main rival at the moment in this market. They need to start \\\\npenetrating into newer cities if they want to distinctly emerge as the leaders of quick commerce. \\\\nZepto has to diversify its revenue streams and stop relying solely on a limited range of sources. \\\\nAccording to the founders of Zepto, they are planning to open a Zepto café that will provide popular \\\\nbrand’s coffee and tea. If it were to become a reality, it may  be successful since metropolitan city\\\\\\'s youth \\\\nrun on caffeine, and hitting up chaayos or blue tokaievery time you feel like drinking one is impractical. If \\\\nZepto wants to make this business a success, they will need more funding. Since Zepto has already \\\\nestablished a reputation for itself and everything associated with that name would benefit from its \\\\ngoodwill, their marketing costs shouldn\\\\\\'t be too high. \\\\nZepto, as well as any other rapid commerce start -up, solely receives criticism for how it treats \\\\ndelivery guys. Due to the shorter time constraints these workers must adhere to, they may drive rashly, \\\\nincreasing the chances of accidents.  Zepto, however, refutes these criticisms by pointing to their \\\\nadvanced technology, which enables the driver to arrive at the destination both securely and on time. \\\\nSWOT Analysis \\\\nStrengths \\\\n• Excellent usage of technology:  With the assistance of www.locus.sh Zepto records its \\\\ncustomers\\\\\\' geographical data, traffic dynamics, delivery time, and so on. They gather and \\\\nevaluate this data to determine whether more dark establishments are needed in the region to \\\\nmeet the 10-minute objective. \\\\n• Being true to their objective:  Zepto ensures that their customers\\\\\\' expectations are met by \\\\ndelivering goods in 10 minutes. Zepto achieves their ai m 90% of the time, which contributes to \\\\nbrand loyalty. \\\\n• Strong financial support:  Zepto is well -funded, which allows it to expand and grow into a \\\\nmarket leader. They currently have a total funding of $360 million. \\\\n• Competent Workforce: The effective management of Zepto is in the hands of highly skilled and \\\\nexperienced professionals. They are Zepto’ s most valuable resource since they are well -\\\\ninformed about the market.

Zepto has everything a successful firm requires: a talented and dedicated \\\\nworkforce, solid funding, and the use of technology to operate rapidly. However, they cannot handle huge \\\\nsales volume since the dark stores they utilise for speedy delivery are not built to support large scale \\\\noperations. They  keep a limited number of fresh items in hand because if they are not sold, they will \\\\nsuffer losses as the items stale. As a result , there is a possibility that the consumer use competitor\\\\\\'s app \\\\nsince the things they want are out of stock. \\\\nOn the face of it, if Blinkit exists& grows, it is difficult for Zepto  to be the market leader. Both \\\\nhave a nearly identical business model, and Bl inkit’ s delivery time is also less than 10 minutes so \\\\nactually they both don’t have anything unique that sets them apart. The only thing that can help Zepto to \\\\ncompete with Blinkit and become a stable business firm is expanding into more cities and having  a wider \\\\nrange of products to pick from. \\\\nZepto along with other apps is effectively breaking the mould of traditional purchasing and \\\\nestablishing an e-consumerism habit. There is no doubt that Zepto is now expanding faster than anybody \\\\nelse in this sector. They are detail-oriented and employ AI-based technologies well. \\\\nZepto is expected to become a unicorn in 2023. 1However, being a unicorn does not imply that \\\\nthe firm is profitable. \\\\nIn the FY22 their revenue was considerable, as seen by the number of orders they received \\\\neach day, but their operational costs were high and  hence they suffered losses. If they want to become a \\\\nprofitable firm, they must expand into newer cities while adhering to their basic principles and finding \\\\nmethods to reduce their operational expenses. \\\\nReferences  \\\\n1. https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto/news \\\\n2. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto \\\\n3. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zepto-29b1 \\\\n4. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/grofers-trusted-delivery-partner \\\\n5.

The main drivers of the expansion of online grocery in these markets have been shifting consumer behaviour and customers are becoming more acclimated to online purchasing. As a result, the market for grocery delivery is considered to be quite hopeful.\\\\nSimilar to this, the Indian grocery delivery business, which had a valuation of USD 2.9 billion in 2020, is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 37.1 per cent from 2021 to 2028. But there are already companies like Swiggy, Instamart, Blinkit, BigBasket, and Amazon Fresh. Is there room for a new company to start up?\\\\nYes! An aggregator is not only flourishing; it is also upending the supermarket delivery business. Indeed, the subject at hand is Zepto.\\\\nZepto is simply the fastest-growing business and the grocery delivery service. Zepto promises to bring groceries in under 10 minutes to your door. But how does the incredibly quick delivery work? Unlike other grocery delivery services, which often take 30 minutes. The heart of Zepto is included in this blog. Continue reading to the end to learn more.\\\\nAbout Zepto\\\\nA startup in Mumbai named Zepto provides a 10-minute grocery delivery service. Zepto is a startup founded by Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra that specialises in quick grocery delivery business.\\\\nZepto is praised for being an expert at delivering food before the new year. In 2021, it produced more than one million deliveries while collaborating with 86+ owners of dark stores in thirteen different locations. Zepto uses its network of “cloud shops” or “micro-warehouses” to fill orders quickly.\\\\nZepto’s key to success is its ability to regularly manufacture over 2,500 items for delivery in less than ten minutes. Everything the company does is centred around that, which is how they’ve been able to expand so swiftly while keeping amazing client loyalty.\\\\nThe Parel-based speedy grocery delivery business has reduced the time it takes to deliver groceries to only 10 minutes, thanks to the dark store concept. Rapid commerce is reportedly the next big opportunity the grocery delivery industry wants to seize. Among the fastest-growing businesses in the faster-delivery industry are startups like Zepto in India and Fridge No More in New York City.\\\\nZepto – Industry\\\\nZepto: Industry The $1 trillion retail industry in India, where groceries account for the great majority of consumer expenditure, is helping e-grocery delivery gain pace. The Indian e-grocery market was estimated to be worth $2.9 billion in 2020, and from 2021 to 2028, it is anticipated to increase at a rate of 37.1 per cent.\\\\nDue to changing consumer preferences, increasing urbanisation, and a tech-savvy population that prefers to make purchases online, the industry has seen an increase in prominence over the past few months.\\\\nAccording to a RedSeer report, the fast commerce market will be worth $30 million by 2021. The same market was expected to rise by 15X to $5 billion in 2025.\\\\nConsumers increasingly use specialised and practical internet platforms for food shopping instead of going to their neighbourhood stores as their standard of living rises, and their daily schedules become busier.\\\\nThe appeal of internet grocery delivery business was more apparent after the COVID-19 outbreak. Due to social distance restrictions, consumers are switching to online food shopping because it is not only practical but also secure.\\\\nZepto – Founders and Team\\\\nAadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, two childhood friends who are both 19 years old, founded Zepto after leaving Stanford University’s esteemed computer science department to go back to their native India and launch a business. The business started operating in April of this year after being created in September of the previous year.\\\\nAadit Palicha\\\\nThe CEO and Co-Founder of both Zepto and KiranaKart is Aadit Palicha. Palicha completed a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Stanford University after earning an IB diploma in Mathematics and Computer Science from GEMS Education. Following the completion of Y Combinator Grade: W21, Aadit began working as a Project Lead for PryvaSee. Then, at the age of 17, Aadit Palicha launched GoPool, his first firm. In April 2020, he quit the company and started KiranaKart and Zepto.\\\\nKaivalya Vohra\\\\nKaivalya Vohra is a co-founder and chief technology officer of both Zepto and KiranaKart. He attended Y Combinator with Aadit and has a computer science degree from Stanford University.\\\\nThe number of employees at Zepto ranges from 51 to 200.\\\\nZepto – Startup Story\\\\nEven those of us who are the most creative struggle to see through our “startup ideas,” which are many. Palicha and Vohra had both enrolled at Stanford to pursue degrees in computer science but had left to pursue their interests in entrepreneurship.\\\\nZepto was born out of the constraints of their homes during the Covid-19 outbreak. Groceries and other necessities would arrive in a few days due to increased demand for delivery services, leaving a gap for speedy delivery. Zepto was then developed using all of this knowledge.\\\\nThese youngsters worked together on numerous initiatives, including a ride-hailing app for children, before being abruptly imprisoned in their Mumbai homes due to Covid restrictions. As the virus spread across the country, grocery delivery business—which local authorities still considered to be important—was still allowed in many areas. Still, the two struggled to receive their supplies as the epidemic grew.\\\\nZepto is getting all the limelight, but Palicha and Vohra’s initial business, KiranaKart, did not get the same attention. On the other hand, Zepto draws inspiration from KiranaKart. KiranaKart was a grocery delivery business, as its name suggests. With Kirana traders, it has made arrangements to deliver groceries in 45 minutes or less. Global Founders Capital, 2 AM Ventures, Contrary Capital, and angel investors led a $730,000 pre-seed investment. At the time, Vohra and Palicha intended to charge Rs 1 for the initial 1.5 lakh delivery.\\\\nZepto Business Model: Dark Store model\\\\nDark storefronts may appear ominous, but they undercut one of the many clever strategies that have kept some retail establishments afloat during the pandemic. Dark stores are distribution centres that aren’t accessible to the public. These small warehouses efficiently and precisely fill orders, giving customers access to resources and choices, including online shopping, same-day delivery, and in-store pickup.\\\\nThe founders said that the dark store model’s brilliance is how quickly they pick, pack, and ship merchandise. The last mile is similar to every other delivery strategy, though.\\\\nA similar methodology has been used in Western countries, but it has never been investigated in the Indian setting. The “dark store model” eliminates the minor issues that any delivery service experiences, such as traffic jams, connectivity, and navigation. According to Zepto, the network’s performance has improved due to the use of location intelligence, geography, population, road patterns, traffic dynamics, weather, last-mile supply availability, real estate values, and other factors. Additionally, it currently operates over 40 dark stores across several locales.\\\\nDark stores, however, can’t handle high sales volumes because they’re designed for rapid deliveries. Zepto, however, refused to make allowances for this model’s flaws. They have nearly a thousand items on display, including the finest deals on fresh vegetables, milk, meat, and kitchen supplies. Additionally, their AI-powered technologies guarantee a seamless changeover between selecting, packing, and shipping.\\\\nBenefits of Zepto Business Model\\\\n-\\\\nImproved Distribution and faster delivery\\\\nZepto can fulfil orders more swiftly and effectively thanks to the dark store. Micro and cold warehouses offer various distribution options, which also physically deliver groceries closer to a particular market group. Zepto can better regulate the distribution and market spread thanks to this.\\\\n-\\\\nBroader Customer Reach\\\\nThe dark stores make distribution hubs more accessible to customers, and they accept orders 24/7 online. Customers are drawn to these platforms and employ their services as a result.\\\\n-\\\\nContactless Shopping\\\\nThe need for contact-free shopping has primarily influenced businesses’ adoption of the “dark store” strategy. Dark stores enable customers to buy food without interacting with other people or going into a physical store. They put things online and have them delivered right away.\\\\n-\\\\nImproved Inventory Control and Better Product Assortment\\\\nDark stores have no customers, greater inventory control, and can handle higher order quantities. Packers can move as swiftly as possible to pack the things in an order thanks to the dark stores’ convenient navigation. Additionally, Zepto’s AI-powered solutions maintain product assortment and inventory stock tracking.\\\\nZepto’s USPs\\\\nZepto’s business strategy is absolutely focused on providing quick service to customers. Zepto, however, also offers several selling factors that distinguish it from its rivals. Nevertheless, the model also takes these into account.\\\\nZepto is known for its rapid commerce and instant delivery. It claims to have a median delivery time of 8 minutes, 47 seconds and completes grocery deliveries in under 10 minutes.\\\\nAccording to the founders, by the time a user verifies his order, it has already been dispatched for delivery. Additionally, practically all orders are completed in less than 10 minutes, although 1% of them may require 15–16 minutes or even longer.\\\\nZepto offers free shipping. Although this USP pales compared to the first, there are no delivery fees. At the same time, other companies like Instacart, Amazon Fresh, and others charge a delivery fee.\\\\nFree service does not imply more expensive goods. It offers some attractive discounts on the mentioned goods and foods, which is still another USP.\\\\nZepto – Future Plans\\\\nThe Mumbai-based company will use the money to expand its clientele, hire more staff, and open more dark stores in new cities. Bengaluru and the Delhi-National Capital Region have it already, and Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, and Kolkata will get it within the next 30 days.\\\\nIt plans to open 100 dark enterprises by the end of the year, covering about 100 pin codes. By the end of this year, quick commerce is expected to reach $300 million, and by the year 2025, it will grow to $5 billion.\\\\nNo one in India has fully grasped marketing, according to co-founder Palicha. He continued by saying that when you look at a few older organisations who are trying to follow this strategy, you’ll discover that many of them lack the consistency to run on a single model and are unfocused. They engage in various activities, which is the biggest problem in every major company.\\\\n“We have seen our median delivery times stabilise if not decrease, mainly because as we scale our coverage and our expansion, it ends up being a factor of individual cloud stores and how they perform,” he said.\\\\nExpress delivery is not a fresh idea; the majority of current e-grocers have tried it in the past, with varying degrees of success. These platforms have been bringing back quick delivery to customers, especially via the dark-store concept, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic’s quicker acceptance of online groceries.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nZepto has secured $100 million in Series C funding, valued at $570 million, led by Y Combinator’s Continuity Fund. The founders say that investments in Zepto will help it reach more customers and provide them with better service. As of now, Zepto operates in the Indian metros. However, it has not revealed its consumer count, but sources say Zepto is growing at 200% every month.\\\\nAs we mentioned earlier, the 10 min grocery delivery service has disrupted the grocery delivery space. When it became clear that it couldn’t deliver groceries in under 10 minutes, Blinkit (December 2021) announced a temporary suspension of its operation in those locations. While the market leader Swiggy announced a $700 million investment in its grocery delivery business, Swiggy Instamart, and plans to complete deliveries in 15 minutes by January 2022. By the end of Q2 in FY22, Fraazo, a grocery delivery business with headquarters in Mumbai, plans to triple the number of its dark stores to 750. Dunzo and BigBasket are vying to enter the quick-commerce market.\\\\nReturning to Zepto, it takes a mix of a laser-like focus, swift action, and a resilient team. Additionally, it entered the supermarket delivery area at an excellent time.\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto Business Model | How Zepto Makes Money\\\\n🔍InsightsThe convenience of Internet food delivery services was greatly enhanced during the pandemic. The dominant player in the online grocery delivery app and company market is influencing users\\\\\\' habits.\\\\nOnline shopping is becoming increasingly common among consumers. As a result, more and more delivery services, like Zepto, have launched their services to meet the ever-increasing demands of their clients for lightning-fast delivery. You should be familiar with the Zepto business model if you are looking to enter the market.\\\\nThe supermarket delivery industry is booming, thank goodness, because it requires less time, effort, and money than other industries. In 2020, the projected value of the online grocery business was $2.9 billion. Through this article, we will go over the basics of Zepto, including its business model and how it generates revenue.\\\\nAbout Zepto\\\\nZepto, founded in 2021 by Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, two former Stanford University students, is a platform for quick commerce that provides a grocery delivery service within 10 minutes. Fast grocery delivery was the driving force for the founding of the firm. Zepto boasts delivery to major cities like Bengaluru, Lucknow, Delhi, Chennai, etc., from its Mumbai headquarters. The original company, Kiranakart Technologies Private Limited, was turned off into Zepto by its founders.\\\\nZepto Business Model\\\\nThe \"dark store model\" serves as the foundation for Zepto\\\\\\'s business model. This involves setting up delivery-only warehouse-style stores in residential regions. The shops sell a variety of products, and the sole way for buyers to place orders is through the Zepto India website or app. Across multiple regions, Zepto now has more than eighty-six dark storefronts. Dark businesses are great for quick shipping, but they may crash under heavy traffic. However, Zepto created an AI-driven system to assist with selecting, packing, and shipping to avoid sacrificing quality or service. Zepto can provide an extensive product line at rock-bottom prices because of this technology, which guarantees a seamless transition from choosing to packaging to delivery.\\\\nZepto India can provide a fast delivery service thanks to the convenience of having outlets close to customers\\\\\\' homes, which is an advantage of the Zepto business model. The elimination of the necessity for employees to utilize the store also allows the company to run with a reduced headcount.\\\\nHow Zepto Makes Money | Zepto Revenue Model\\\\nA little commission is charged for each order placed using the Zepto Grocery app in India. Helping to pay the costs of running the app and ensuring that consumers have a great experience, this commission is usually 2-3% of the total order amount.\\\\nWith almost $1.3 billion raised across eight rounds, Zepto is certainly a no-money lightweight, making it the first unicorn startup of 2023.\\\\nIn recent times, the Zepto business model has experienced tremendous expansion. Their incomes increased by 800% while their burn rate per order reduced by 5%. The reason for this rise is that Zepto boasts a 50% growth rate per month.\\\\nHere’s an easy-to-understand version of Zepto’s revenue model:\\\\n- Sales of Products: Zepto makes money by selling groceries, home goods, and personal care items on its website. They buy products from local suppliers and brands, keeping prices low. Sometimes, they charge a little more for certain items compared to regular stores, which helps boost revenue.\\\\n- Delivery Charges: Zepto charges a delivery fee based on factors like how far the delivery is, the order size, or any special deals. This fee helps cover the cost of fast delivery and brings in extra money.\\\\n- Subscription Models: Zepto offers membership plans for regular customers, giving benefits like free delivery or special discounts. This makes it easier for frequent buyers to make purchases.\\\\n- Advertisement and Promotions: Zepto partners with brands for advertisements on their platform. Brands pay to get more visibility. They also create special offers or coupons in the app to attract more customers.\\\\n- Data Monetization: Zepto collects useful data from customers. They can sell insights from this data to brands and suppliers to help them understand customer behavior and improve their products.\\\\n- Fulfillment and Logistics: Zepto could offer its delivery and logistics services to other businesses, creating another source of income.\\\\n- New Category Expansion: Zepto may expand beyond groceries to sell other items like electronics, health products, or prepared meals, increasing their revenue streams.\\\\nChallenges and Considerations\\\\n- Pricing Pressure: Zepto must balance keeping prices low and offering fast delivery while making a profit.\\\\n- Customer Retention: Zepto needs to keep customers loyal with great service and rewards programs.\\\\n- Operational Efficiency: Zepto must keep its delivery and logistics system efficient to control costs and maximize profits.\\\\nZepto Financials\\\\n| Zepto Financials | FY22 | FY23 | FY24 |\\\\n|---|---|---|---|\\\\n| Operating Revenue | INR 142.3 crore | INR 2,026 crore | INR 4,454 crore |\\\\n| Expenses | INR 532.7 crore | INR 3,350 crore | INR 5,754 crore |\\\\n| Profit/Loss | INR 390.3 crore (loss) | INR 1,272 crore (loss) | INR 1,248 crore (loss) |\\\\nIn FY23, the quick-commerce startup’s operating revenue stood at INR 2,026 crore. In FY24, Zepto\\\\\\'s operating revenue saw a growth of about 120%, reaching INR 4,454 crore.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s losses saw a slight decrease of 2% in FY24, to INR 1,248.6 crore from INR 1,272 crore in FY23.\\\\nUSP Of Zepto\\\\nCustomers in a rush will be enticed by Zepto\\\\\\'s promise of ultra-fast delivery—a mere 10 minutes—since the company dominates this segment.\\\\nZepto has been aggressively growing its presence in key Indian cities, particularly in metro and big urban areas, to guarantee the quickest delivery times imaginable.\\\\nZepto SWOT Analysis\\\\nZepto Strength\\\\n- Zepto can process orders more quickly and efficiently thanks to its dark store and speedy packaging. Several distribution options are made available by micro and cold warehouses, which physically deliver groceries closer to a certain market group.\\\\n- To maintain an up-to-date procedure and an app that is easy to use, Zepto makes use of a broad variety of software. Put together a crack team of professionals who are well-versed in all things related, such as data analytics, software development, and artificial intelligence. As a result, the market delivery system is more within the company\\\\\\'s control.\\\\nZepto Weakness\\\\n- Customers are less likely to purchase due to the lack of high-quality product images.\\\\n- Delivery is only offered in a limited number of areas. There is a limit on their ability to invest in marketing or expand operations due to limited human, or infrastructure resources.\\\\nZepto Opportunities\\\\n- Zepto may explore opportunities to extend its business operations internationally by entering new markets and expanding its clientele on a global scale.\\\\n- When new technology or industry trends emerge, Zepto may have opportunities to expand its product and service offerings or create innovative solutions.\\\\nZepto Threats\\\\n- Rules and regulations or the need for regulations and developments pertinent to Zepto\\\\\\'s sector can complicate compliance and increase operational expenses.\\\\n- To retain customers over the long term, Zepto must fulfill its word and deliver on time every time. Failing on this line means a massive loss of business.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s founders assert that the additional acquisitions will strengthen the company\\\\\\'s ability to connect with customers and improve its level of service. As of this very moment, Zepto is operational in the metros of India. In any case, the company has not disclosed its consumer calculation; however, several sources claim that Zepto is growing at a rate of 200% per month.\\\\nFor a company to achieve success, it takes a lot of things, and Zepto has everything. They have a fantastic team, are quick to act, and are focused on their goals. In addition to this, they planned their entrance into the supermarket delivery market with great precision. Even though they have only been in operation for a few years, they have already raised the expectations of their customers and are heading towards a company strategy that is more focused on the client.\\\\nFAQs\\\\nWhat is Zepto?\\\\nZepto is a startup based in Mumbai that offers a 10-minute grocery delivery service.

With this, Zepto has become the first unicorn of 2023 in India. This round was led by StepStone Group and Goodwater Capital, with participation from existing investors Nexus Venture Partners and GladeBrook Capital.\\\\nThe funding will be used to expand Zepto’s operations across India and to develop new products and services. Zepto is seen as one of the few players in the market that has the potential to be successful.\\\\nZepto business model was developed by a couple of successful instant grocery delivery startup founders. The company was founded by two teenagers Aadit Palecha and his childhood buddy Kaivalya Vohra who were both 19 at the time. The Zepto business model works within the quick commerce segment in India.\\\\nBoth the Zepto founders were studying computer science at Stanford University and left the course to enter quick commerce in India. The Zepto business model promises to deliver your grocery in 10 minutes.\\\\nThe company began its operations in Mumbai in 2021 and has since extended its operations.\\\\nThe arrival of Zepto in India\\\\nEven the arrival of the startup in India was a bit serendipitous. Both Kaivalya Vohra and Aadit Palicha had returned to the country for a break just before the coronavirus pandemic engulfed India. Both these teenagers had partnered on several other projects earlier. They created a ride-hailing commute app suitable for school-going kids. But this time they found themselves locked in their homes when they arrived in Mumbai.\\\\nWith the pandemic raging on mercilessly, both the teenagers were struggling to get their grocery supplies. This was even though grocery deliveries were categorized as essential by the government. They felt the need for having an online player for the grocery delivery sector in India. Despite being one of the largest markets in the world they were still grappling with some execution errors.\\\\nAlso Read\\\\n“I was told service class people cannot afford to start a business”\\\\nHow Zepto works\\\\nZepto has places called dark stores or micro fulfillment centers that lie in higher-demand neighborhoods. These dark stores use technology for performing tasks such as the placement of products. Some other tasks they perform include deciding the store locations, and mapping delivery routes for avoiding heavy traffic congestions. The company is already delivering items that include cooking necessities, fresh produce, personal care items, snacks and beverages, and home cleaning items.\\\\nAlso Read\\\\n“Best-selling on Zomato, still I want my own online platform”\\\\nAcquiring talent\\\\nOne of the main things that went in the right direction for the startup was the talent acquisition department. They were able to attract several top-profile executives from Amazon Uber, Pharmeasy, Flipkart, and Dream 11 to join their organization.\\\\nThe main thing that led to so many top executives deciding to join Zepto was that it allowed several people that moved to Bangalore to come back to Mumbai. However, the aggressive growth of the startup, its ambition, and its disciplined execution have led to several people that are similarly inclined to be attracted to the company.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nSeveral other players are trying to participate in the market and trying to grow quickly. But they cannot promise things such as 10-minute delivery as consistently as Zepto. This period extends to 30, 40, and 45 minutes in most cases. Zepto is a detail-oriented and intense business with strong technical and operating discipline that allows them to pull off the 10-minute delivery.\\\\nBuild your own app like Zepto\\\\nIf you are looking to set up an on-demand business one of the best places to visit for a technology-based solution will be Jungleworks.

The company has strategically located dark stores to ensure speedy and efficient order fulfillment. Zepto has also partnered with a variety of delivery services to guarantee that orders are delivered promptly to customers\\\\\\' doorsteps. This integrated approach demonstrates Zepto\\\\\\'s dedication to providing convenience and efficiency in the grocery delivery industry. Zepto\\\\\\'s business strategy revolves around offering ultra-fast delivery, with a focus on customer convenience and satisfaction.\\\\nPromotion\\\\nZepto employs a diverse marketing approach, utilizing digital channels like social media and influencer marketing, alongside out-of-home advertising for brand visibility. Positive media coverage enhances its reputation, while meme marketing fosters audience engagement. A referral program incentivizes customer loyalty, contributing to both acquisition and retention. Zepto\\\\\\'s concise and varied strategies solidify its dynamic presence in the market.\\\\nZepto Target Audience\\\\nZepto mainly targets busy people living in cities who want quick grocery deliveries. Its customers include young professionals, students, and families who need things fast. The service is for people who like using technology to save time. Zepto focuses on city areas, offering a simple online shopping experience.\\\\nZepto Marketing Strategy\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s marketing strategy has played a crucial role in growing its business to this extent. A lot of innovative steps have been taken by the company to support and boost its business growth. Zepto\\\\\\'s target audience is generally young adults and the modern generation. Here is the detailed overview you must read.\\\\n10-Mins Delivery Strategy\\\\nThe idea of online grocery delivery is not new. Startups like Dunzo and Blinkit are already providing these services. The fact that distinguishes Zepto from all its competitors is its 10-minute delivery of groceries and other products. You might have heard about Zomato Instant, which provides food delivery within 10 minutes, but Zepto is the first player in the grocery delivery segment to offer a 10-minute grocery delivery service.\\\\nThe idea of 10-minute grocery delivery is unique, but it was not that easy to implement. To fulfill its promise to deliver groceries in the specified time, Zepto introduced the concept of the dark store model. The dark store is like a fulfillment center for Zepto; it is not accessible to the public but is efficient enough to fulfill orders rapidly.\\\\nArtificial intelligence is used by Zepto to pick, pack, and transport orders in leaps and bounds. Whenever any customer places an order, a person with a tablet is assigned to pick up and pack the order within 60 seconds. It means that at the time you make the payment, someone is already preparing your order for dispatch. The company claims that 8 minutes and 40 seconds is the average delivery time they have achieved.\\\\nZepto operates its dark store delivery within a 3 km radius, and it doesn\\\\\\'t penalize its delivery boy for late delivery.\\\\nDiscounts are a way to attract customers, but as a new player in the segment, offering huge discounts was not a sustainable option for Zepto. Hence, the 10-minute delivery strategy comes out to be a panacea for Zepto.\\\\nAdvertising and Branding Strategy\\\\nThere is not only one thing responsible for the success of Zepto, but an incredible advertising strategy has also played an important role in the success. L&K Saatchi and Saatchi is an advertising agency that was assigned to advertise Zepto and build a strong brand image in front of consumers. The main theme of all the ads is to emphasize the 10-minute delivery of Zepto.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s ads are attention-grabbing ads that suddenly capture the focus, and this is what every brand wants. When a boy suddenly wakes up and runs toward the door, it creates a question in the minds of viewers about why he is running. The twist and excitement of the ad make it capable of grabbing the attention of viewers.\\\\nIf I try to summarize the above ad in a single sentence, then it is like this: From the time you wake up until the time you sleep, every essential product will get delivered to your doorstep within 10 minutes.\\\\nEach ad that was created is meant to make the consumer feel how Zepto is capable of changing their daily grocery shopping habit. Since advertising is the best way to market the product and build a strong brand image, Zepto has fully utilized the benefits of marketing.\\\\nAdvertising was not only done on social media channels, but it also planted its hoardings in the streets of cities in which Zepto\\\\\\'s services are operational.\\\\nSocial Media Meme Marketing\\\\nIn today\\\\\\'s generation of technology and innovation, we cannot ignore the power of social media. There is a huge chance you\\\\\\'ll find your target audience on the social media platform. Hence, every brand is focusing on social media marketing. Zepto is also not behind the race; it leverages the social platform to engage its audience through meme marketing.\\\\nFor the recently released movie \\\\\\'Avatar: The Way of Water,\\\\\\' Zepto created a meme to grab the consumer\\\\\\'s attention by following the ongoing trend. It\\\\\\'s just one example, but if you visit Zepto\\\\\\'s social media page, you\\\\\\'ll find plenty of such memes.\\\\nMeme marketing is a trend today because people often share memes with their loved ones. This will help the brand get some organic reach and, at the same time, promote the brand. Zepto knows the power of memes very well. That\\\\\\'s why if you open their page on any platform like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, you\\\\\\'ll find amazing memes.\\\\nTh has gained a lot of positive feedback from customers. Along with meme marketing, they sometimes collaborate with famous social media influencers to make videos for them. This tactic helps to create a loyal fanbase and also helps the brand image flourish.\\\\nMicro-Moments Marketing Strategy\\\\nMicro-moments are key moments in a customer\\\\\\'s journey where brands can influence buying decisions. Zepto understands this and focuses on sending the right messages at the right time to connect with customers. Studies show that over 150 billion mobile micro-moments happen every day, influencing more than 70% of purchases. Brands using this approach see a 74% success rate in increasing revenue.\\\\nCustomer Acquisition and Retention Strategy\\\\nPlayers in the quick commerce industry like Dunzo, Swiggy Instamart, and Blinkit are well-funded and established. These big giants have already acquired a huge market share in the segment by offering huge discounts and other offers. So it was not easy for Zepto to acquire customers and retain them.\\\\nDiscounts are not the only things that attract consumers. Consumers are always hungry for something new, and exactly here, Zepto played its game. Acquisition of customers and retaining customers are two different things. Other players in the segment have easily acquired customers but struggled to retain them.\\\\nCustomers are used to switching platforms and ordering items from the app, where the discount is heavy. In the case of Zepto, it has given discounts and at the same time provided high-speed free delivery. It helps to enhance Zepto\\\\\\'s retention rate significantly.\\\\nNo other players in the segment were making that fast delivery. This eventually leads to an increase in Zepto\\\\\\'s consumer base.\\\\nDigital Marketing\\\\nZepto uses digital marketing to reach busy customers with fast and targeted ads. They focus on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook to promote quick delivery and special offers. Zepto also uses precision messaging or micro-moments to engage customers when they are likely to make a purchase. Through online campaigns, Zepto builds brand awareness and encourages customers to use their service for fast grocery deliveries.\\\\nReferral Programs\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s referral program plays a crucial role in its successful marketing strategy. The program offers unique codes to its users for sharing, which incentivizes both existing and new users with rewards such as discounts. This helps in cost-effective customer acquisition and increases customer retention. The program\\\\\\'s seamless integration with social media, multiple reward options, and gamification elements make it a dynamic and impactful tool for Zepto\\\\\\'s growth and customer loyalty.\\\\nBeyond transactional benefits, Zepto\\\\\\'s referral initiative is a brand-building powerhouse, fostering advocacy and community engagement. By creating a positive customer experience and utilizing word-of-mouth influence, the program stands as a testament to the brand\\\\\\'s commitment to customer satisfaction and strategic marketing prowess.\\\\nPartnerships with Influencers\\\\nZepto partners with social media influencers who create authentic content to showcase its services. This helps Zepto build trust, connect with specific audiences, and reach more customers. This approach has fueled rapid growth, with the company raising over $300 million in just one year, emphasizing its focus on long-term customer relationships.\\\\nMarketing Campaign of Zepto\\\\nboAt, India’s leading audio brand, has teamed up with Zepto to bring high-quality audio products to your doorstep in just 10 minutes. This partnership combines boAt’s top-notch audio expertise with Zepto’s quick delivery, making it easier to enjoy music, movies, podcasts, and more. Whether it\\\\\\'s a party, a podcast, or binge-watching, boAt and Zepto ensure the perfect audio experience is just a tap away.\\\\nA marketing campaign is an integral part of any brand\\\\\\'s effort to increase its visibility and create brand awareness. The same is true for Zepto. In the IPL 2022, Zepto created and ran a marketing campaign that truly had a new approach.\\\\nMost of the time, we have faced the issue of time stretching in different places like airports, hospitals, and restaurants. Because we usually wait for a long time in these places, it became quite common for us, but Zepto addressed this issue and showcased it in its campaign in such a way that, at the same time, it also represented the 10-minute delivery promise of Zepto.\\\\nIn this campaign, three famous singers—Shankar Mahadevan, Usha Uthup, and Kailash Kher—have given their incredible voices. Three ads have been created for this campaign with the voices of these three singers. They have stretched the time with their voices in such a way that it shows our habit of waiting. At the same time, Zepto implements its tagline of 10-minute delivery.\\\\nL&K Saatchi and Saatchi created this campaign very beautifully, and the whole marketing campaign turned out to be a huge success for Zepto.\\\\nIn this brand campaign, Zepto has come up with a significant collaboration featuring renowned cricketer Jasprit Bumrah as the brand ambassador. Developed by L&K Saatchi & Saatchi, the \\\\\\'Groceries delivered at Bumrah Speed\\\\\\' campaign embodies speed, precision, consistency, and rigor. This initiative not only introduces Indian audiences to cutting-edge special effects but also promises an experience comparable to the grandeur of cinema.\\\\nThe campaign\\\\\\'s focal point will be on Disney+ Hotstar, other leading OTT platforms, Zepto\\\\\\'s application, social media channels, and various digital platforms. Outdoor advertising will be prominently displayed across major cities where Zepto operates, ensuring widespread visibility and engagement.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s \\\\\\'Nahi Milega\\\\\\' brand campaign underscores its commitment, emphasizing that while life may present unattainable challenges, unlimited free deliveries on Zepto are certain.\\\\nZepto adopted an unconventional approach by introducing Uncle Ji, a character from Delhi, several weeks before unveiling their brand campaign. The intention was to disrupt social media with Uncle Ji\\\\\\'s distinctive personality, straightforward expressions of reality, and the recurring catchphrase \\\\\\'Nahi Milega\\\\\\' (won\\\\\\'t be available).\\\\nZepto said Uncle Ji\\\\\\'s character achieved remarkable organic traction, accumulating 10 million impressions with a substantial 10% engagement rate across all social media platforms. Uncle Ji trended at #6 on Twitter and received endorsements from popular Twitter celebrities and Instagram meme pages, solidifying his status as a cultural icon in India.\\\\nZepto USP\\\\nZepto’s business model focuses on customers and offers instant delivery, setting it apart from competitors. The app is known for being the fastest, delivering groceries in as little as 10 minutes, with a claimed average time of 8 minutes and 47 seconds. When users place an order, it\\\\\\'s already on its way. Zepto also offers free shipping, unlike Amazon Fresh and Instacart, which charge delivery fees.

Further personalize through historical app usage patterns and survey feedback.\\\\nOptimizing Content for the Micro-Scale\\\\nWith ultra-short attention spans, micro content earns engagement.\\\\n– Make it Snackable: Condense notifications into bite-sized push messages or mini-ads with simple calls-to-action\\\\n– Trigger Intrigue: Pose questions or offer promo codes to prompt instant app visits\\\\n– Speak to Their World: Use contextual warnings about traffic or weather to underscore real-time utility\\\\nIntegrating Zepto Across Marketing Mix\\\\nWhile micro-moments represent touchpoints for engagement, integrate Zepto thinking across efforts:\\\\n– Campaign Concepting: Build creative stories bridging macro moments showcasing overarching branding with micro-moment activation\\\\n– Retargeting: Remind those who previously expressed interest via precision re-targeting during identified micro-windows when they’re most receptive to convert\\\\nIn summary, micro-moments permeate the customer journey.

The best part of Zepto marketing strategy is the 10-minute guarantee delivery. As a result, you can get groceries delivered to your doorstep that you previously purchased from the local general store.\\\\nWhat is Zepto? What Types of Companies Comes Under the Zepto Marketing Strategy?\\\\nZepto offers service only through the official application. At present, it has more than 80 dark stores throughout the country. These stores are primarily in tier one cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, and more. Zepto is a pan-India company that started its operations in April 2021. However, it was founded in September 2020.\\\\nThe primary reason Zepto has a successful business model in India is that Zepto marketing strategy includes producing 2500+ goods within 10 minutes. As a result, it was impossible for any top delivery or e-commerce sites.\\\\nWhether it is the marketing strategy of Zepto or any other marketing strategy, there are a lot of crucial factors. The idea is one of the most important ones of them. The Story of Zepto starts when the two founders, who were studying computer science, got tempted with their creative idea to start a business.\\\\nWith the idea to deliver food to your doorsteps in the least possible time, Zepto was introduced. The most crucial thing was that Zepto was introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the strict lockdown, when people were striving hard to get out of their homes, the founders worked hard to make the delivery possible even during the restrictions.\\\\nHow does Zepto Delivery Work? A Detail on Zepto Business Model\\\\nThe Zepto business model was inspired by the idea on which KiranaKart depends. KiranaKart depends on is for the local shopkeepers and managers. They deliver the goods and products within 45 minutes of placing the order. Zepto marketing strategy is based on similar ideas. Both the founders were bachelors, and they had to struggle a lot to get food delivered. This is where they got the idea of creating such an app that quickly provides grocery items.\\\\nAlso Read: 8 Compelling Reasons to Invest in a Grocery App Development Company\\\\nTheir vision is to open Zepto Dark stores all over India and expand the brand at the top level. They are planning to increase the team from 400 to 800 by 2023. You must think that Zepto app is the only company to be the fastest delivery online shopping app. At the same time, they are facing intense competition from rival companies like Swiggy, Zomato, Blinkit and Dunzo. The best part is all the competitors are offering the same service at equal rates.\\\\nTherefore, it was not easy to stay in the top place. Zepto marketing strategy required more business skills and investment to be the fastest delivery app in India. They introduced new standards to transform their work in the delivery infrastructure – right from the basic level. In simple words, ground-level work was still needed.\\\\nFunding & Investment for Zepto Marketing Strategy\\\\nThe leading sources for Zepto’s funds are Y combinator community funds and Glade brook capital partners. Both invested 100 million dollars and 4.4 billion rupees, respectively. Zepto has a successful business model in India, showing continuous growth. You can see the Zepto marketing strategy’s success from the number of stores they have opened across cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune and more.\\\\nAs the fastest delivery app in India, Zepto delivers grocery items only in the stores’ available areas. The technical office is in Bangalore. This is where all the technicalities are handled, while the operations are done from the Mumbai office. So, if you ask if the supermarket business is profitable in India, we will say YES. Why? Popular apps like Flipkart, Uber, Dream11 and more have their key executives in the Zepto app. Recently, Lazypay and Pescafresh partnered with Zepto.\\\\nZepto Talent Acquisition\\\\nAnother important thing that has worked in favour of a successful Zepto marketing strategy is acquiring talent. Top executives decided to join Zepto because it allowed so many people that had shifted to Bangalore to come back to Mumbai. However, the fast growth of the start-up, its ambition and the disciplined execution encouraged several people to be attracted to the company.\\\\nOrder Volume Claims\\\\nBlinkit & Instamart claimed that their weekly order volume increased to more than a million. So, the question is, what about Zepto? How many orders are they delivering now? Well, Zepto is not too keen to publish the numbers. However, they are saying that with the current numbers, they shall easily surpass the competitors in the market.\\\\nZepto Business Model: Dark Store Model\\\\nDark stores might seem a sinister option, but it is a great idea that helped multiple retail businesses stay afloat throughout the pandemic. The dark stores are distribution outlets that are not open to visitors. These are micro warehouses that quickly and accurately fulfil orders. Therefore, they offer shoppers resources and options like buying products online, pickup in-store and same-day delivery.\\\\nAccording to the founders and shareholders of the Zepto app, the magic of the dark store model is how they became the fastest delivery app in India. With the help of the dark stores, they could pick, pack, and dispatch the goods within 60 seconds. However, the last section is just like any other delivery model.\\\\nSuch a grocery delivery model is implemented in developed nations; however, the model was never explored in India. The dark store model reduces the trivial challenges that any delivery service faces. These include navigation, traffic congestion, and connectivity.\\\\nZepto marketing strategy used geography, location intelligence, population, road patterns, traffic dynamics, last-minute supply availability, weather, real estate values and others. All these factors improved the network’s overall performance.\\\\nDark stores are meant for instant deliveries and can’t handle the sales volume. However, the Zepto grocery app didn’t compromise on the shortcomings of this model. They have thousands of products on display, fresh produce, meat, milk, kitchen refills and more at the best bargain. Also, the AI-powered tool ensures a smooth transition, right from picking, packing, and delivering. All these features make the Zepto grocery app the fastest online shopping app.\\\\nBenefits of Zepto Business Model\\\\nThere are a lot of benefits to the Zepto Business Model. In the following section of the blog, we shall mention a few.\\\\n1. Better Distribution & Faster Delivery\\\\nThe dark store enables Zepto to fulfill orders quickly and more efficiently. In addition, the micro and cold warehouses offer several distribution choices and bring groceries closer to a particular market segment. Thus, you can see that Zepto has higher control over the market spread and distribution. It is another reason why Zepto is the fastest delivery app in India.\\\\n2. Better and Broader Customer Reach\\\\nOne of the dark stores’ most important features is bringing the distribution centres close to the consumers. The best thing about these stores is they are always online to take orders. It is what brings consumers to such platforms and uses their services. Therefore, it is one of the essential features that made the successful Zepto marketing strategy.\\\\n3. Contactless Shopping\\\\nThere is no denying the fact that the need for contact-free shopping is a critical factor for businesses to adopt the “dark store” approach. The dark stores allow consumers to purchase groceries in a contactless way without entering a physical store. All you must do is place orders, and you will get them instantly.\\\\n4. Better Inventory Control and Product Assortment\\\\nZepto’s business model and Zepto marketing strategy worked because they chose dark stores. The dark stores are customer-free zones, and they have better control over the inventory. Therefore, they can easily manage larger order volumes. In addition, the dark stores are designed to ensure easy navigation, allowing the packers to move quickly to pack the items in an order. Also, the AI-powered tools keep the inventory stock track and provide product assortment.\\\\nZepto’s USP\\\\nZepto’s business model is customer-centric, and it is an instant delivery model. However, Zepto offers a few selling points that set it apart from its competitors. Still, these are also included in the model.\\\\nOne of the main reasons the Zepto app is the fastest online shopping app is because Zepto has instant delivery and is regarded as quick commerce. They are capable enough to fulfill the grocery delivery in 10 minutes. Also, they claim to have a delivery time of 8 minutes and 47 seconds.\\\\nAccording to the founders, when a user checks the order, it is already shipped out for delivery. Therefore, it is another essential element that makes Zepto marketing strategy successful. They fulfill almost every order within 10 minutes. Only one percent of the charges might take 15-16 minutes.\\\\nAnother crucial factor for successful business models in India is to offer free shipping. Zepto offers free shipping. Even though this USP has got dim compared to the former one, it still doesn’t charge a delivery fee. On the other hand, Amazon Fresh & Instacart have delivery fees.\\\\nYou must remember that the free service doesn’t mean costlier products. Yet another USP is that it offers excellent discounts on its list of products and groceries.\\\\nZepto’s Online Ad Campaigns\\\\nZepto marketing campaigns are one of the best ones you shall see in the ad campaigns of recent companies. Zepto witnessed growth primarily because of its unique ad campaigns online. All of this they achieved in a short time. Did you know? L&K Saatchi & Saatchi was behind 3 of Zepto’s recent ads.\\\\nThe idea behind all Zepto’s ad campaigns is that time is an expandable commodity in India. Therefore, you cannot afford to waste it. Whether you must board a flight or wait for the food at a restaurant, we all have experienced stretchable time. It is where Zepto ad campaigns have stood apart.\\\\nHere are examples of the Zepto marketing strategy ad campaign where they surprisingly used three famous singers. Usha Uthup, Shankar Mahadevan & Kailash Kher are cast in unusual roles where they must stretch time in their way – thus highlighting the objective of Zepto, which is on-time delivery.\\\\nThe ad campaigns have paved the way for the Zepto app to be the most talked about brand.\\\\nHere’s What Zepto’s Chief Marketing Officer has to Say\\\\nAmritansu Nanda, Chief Marketing Officer of Zepto, says, “Our consumers lead busy, fast-paced lives. At Zepto, through our on-time delivery promise and at the back of our exceptional tech, we constantly strive to let them know and reassure them that we value their time. This campaign, featuring some of the most iconic pop-culture voices of the country, brings alive our proposition of quick delivery and strikes the right chord with our core TG through relatable entertainment. It is also a critical milestone in our journey towards becoming synonymous with quick-commerce in India.”\\\\nKartik Smetacek, Jt NCD, L&K Saatchi, and Saatchi added, “It’s often said clients get the work they deserve. Zepto is a case in point. From scripting these to presenting them to producing them, working on the campaign was an absolute pleasure, with the agency and client working as one team completely committed to the product. I think the results speak for themselves.\\\\nIn Conclusion\\\\nZepto marketing strategy has helped the brand to grow as the fastest delivery app in India.

Known for its ultra-fast 10-minute delivery model, Zepto has quickly risen to become one of the leaders in the quick commerce industry, all while building a strong brand presence. But what has driven its remarkable success?\\\\nLet’s take a closer look at Zepto’s marketing strategy and understand how this young startup became a force to be reckoned with in the competitive quick commerce landscape.\\\\nUnderstanding Zepto’s Marketing Mix\\\\nTo understand Zepto’s success, we need to break down its marketing mix. From the products it offers to its promotional tactics, every element plays a part in making Zepto a standout brand in the grocery delivery industry.\\\\n1. Product: A Promise of Speed and Convenience\\\\nZepto’s product offering revolves around the promise of convenience. The company delivers a wide variety of products ranging from groceries, fresh produce, household items, to personal care products—all in as little as 10 minutes. This ultra-fast delivery service has become the company’s hallmark, making it a go-to option for busy professionals, students, and families living in urban areas.\\\\nThe introduction of private-label products has also enhanced Zepto’s market appeal. By offering high-quality items at competitive prices, Zepto has not only captured customer interest but has also encouraged repeat business, thus fostering brand loyalty.\\\\n2. Price: Competitive Yet Sustainable\\\\nZepto’s pricing strategy is both competitive and sustainable. Unlike some competitors who rely heavily on deep discounts to attract customers, Zepto focuses on providing a value proposition that goes beyond pricing. The company offers attractive discounts and promotional offers, making it an appealing choice for budget-conscious consumers. However, the real game-changer is its focus on speed—something that traditional grocery delivery services don’t provide. This approach ensures that Zepto’s customers receive more than just low prices; they receive unparalleled service in terms of delivery speed.\\\\n3. Place: Convenience at Your Fingertips\\\\nZepto’s business model revolves around making grocery shopping as easy and efficient as possible for its customers. The platform operates primarily through a mobile app that enables users to place orders quickly and effortlessly. The app is designed with a user-friendly interface, catering to tech-savvy, time-conscious customers who value convenience.\\\\nZepto also uses a dark store model to ensure fast order fulfillment. These fulfillment centers, though not open to the public, are strategically located to facilitate swift deliveries. The dark store model allows Zepto to manage inventory efficiently and ensure that deliveries are completed in record time.\\\\n4. Promotion: Building a Strong Brand Identity\\\\nZepto’s promotional strategy is diverse and impactful, utilizing both traditional and digital channels to establish a strong brand presence. A key component of its promotional efforts is its focus on advertising and branding. Partnering with the advertising agency L&K Saatchi and Saatchi, Zepto created campaigns that emphasize its unique 10-minute delivery promise. The brand’s ads are designed to captivate and engage viewers by highlighting everyday situations where time is of the essence, ultimately showcasing how Zepto can solve this problem with its rapid delivery service.\\\\nAdditionally, Zepto has adopted social media meme marketing, a clever and engaging way to reach younger audiences. By creating memes around current events, pop culture, and trending topics, Zepto has been able to connect with its audience in a light-hearted, relatable manner. This not only helps the brand stay relevant but also builds a strong community around its product.\\\\nThe 10-Minute Delivery Strategy: A Game-Changer\\\\nWhen Zepto entered the market, it was not the first company to offer online grocery delivery. However, it was the first to promise deliveries in just 10 minutes—a unique selling point that set the brand apart from the competition. In the highly competitive world of quick commerce, speed is everything. Zepto’s 10-minute delivery service has proven to be its defining feature, allowing it to attract a loyal customer base.\\\\nAchieving such rapid delivery times is no easy feat. To fulfill its promise, Zepto relies on the dark store model, which enables efficient packing and dispatching of orders. Once a customer places an order, the system ensures that it is picked, packed, and dispatched within a minute. Zepto also uses advanced technology, including artificial intelligence, to streamline the entire process, from inventory management to delivery logistics. With an average delivery time of just 8 minutes and 47 seconds, Zepto is living up to its commitment of ultra-fast service.\\\\nAdvertising and Branding: Creating Buzz and Building Trust\\\\nZepto’s advertising strategy is another key factor that has contributed to its success. Through clever, engaging campaigns, the company has been able to capture the public’s attention and create a strong brand identity. One of its most successful campaigns featured the idea of waiting—something we all do in everyday life, whether it’s waiting in line at an airport or waiting for food at a restaurant. In the campaign, Zepto cleverly juxtaposes the frustration of waiting with its promise of 10-minute delivery, showing that while many things in life take time, Zepto’s service doesn’t.\\\\nBeyond traditional ads, Zepto also made waves with its innovative use of meme marketing. By leveraging the power of humor and social media trends, Zepto has created a relatable, fun brand that resonates with younger audiences. This approach not only garners attention but also promotes organic engagement, as users share Zepto’s memes across their networks.\\\\nCustomer Acquisition and Retention: Building Loyalty with Speed and Service\\\\nOne of the challenges for Zepto in such a competitive market was acquiring and retaining customers. While discounts and offers can attract new users, they don’t necessarily ensure long-term loyalty. Zepto, however, focuses on creating a unique experience that keeps customers coming back. The company’s commitment to ultra-fast delivery, combined with its excellent customer service, has led to impressive customer retention rates.\\\\nZepto also leverages referral programs to drive customer acquisition. The referral system rewards existing users for referring new customers, making it an effective strategy for growing its user base. By offering incentives for both the referrer and the referee, Zepto ensures that customers are motivated to spread the word about the service.\\\\nZepto’s Unique Selling Proposition (USP)\\\\nWhat truly sets Zepto apart from its competitors is its ability to deliver groceries in 10 minutes without compromising on the quality or price of the products. This quick delivery model, coupled with free shipping, offers customers a compelling reason to choose Zepto over other grocery delivery services, many of which charge for delivery. Zepto’s ability to maintain competitive prices while offering faster service has made it a preferred choice for urban dwellers.\\\\nConclusion: A Rising Star in Quick Commerce\\\\nZepto’s meteoric rise in the quick commerce industry is a testament to the power of innovation, speed, and smart marketing. By focusing on customer needs—specifically, the desire for speed and convenience—Zepto has carved out a niche in a crowded market. With a combination of creative advertising, meme marketing, and an unbeatable delivery speed, Zepto has become the go-to app for time-conscious consumers.\\\\nIn a short time, Zepto has achieved what many of its competitors have struggled to do: build a loyal customer base, establish a strong brand identity, and deliver on its promises. As the quick commerce industry continues to grow, Zepto’s marketing strategies will likely serve as a blueprint for future startups looking to make an impact in the competitive world of online grocery delivery.\\\\nFAQs\\\\n1.

The team is shipping an MVP and iterating quickly, so it may not be perfect on Day 1, but it\\\\\\'s worth it to launch fast :D Café is scaling rapidly: we\\\\\\'re launching 100+ Cafés a month and already clocking 30K orders/day.\"\\\\nWhile the Cafe offerings will be available through the new standalone app, customers can still access these services via the main Zepto application. This approach mirrors\\\\nZomato\\\\\\'s strategy with Blinkit, providing multiple entry points for consumer engagement.\\\\nThe new app comes at a time of intense competition in India\\\\\\'s quick commerce sector, with major players like Swiggy and Zomato also exploring rapid food delivery services.\\\\nThe launch aligns with Zepto\\\\\\'s broader expansion plans, which include scaling from its current presence in about two dozen cities to over 50 cities in the next quarter. The company recently surpassed a billion dollars in top-line revenue and is targeting profitability in the upcoming fiscal year.\\\\n                \\\\n                MUMBAI: Instant delivery is the new way of life. After grocery and a host of other non-grocery household supplies, 10-minute delivery is fast becoming a fad in the food space. Taking competition directly to the doors of Zomato and Swiggy, Zepto is launching a separate app for quicker deliveries of food, branded as Zepto Café, allowing consumers to get chai, samosa and pizza delivered to their doorstep in 10 minutes. Indians are familiar with 30-minute delivery of certain food items like pizzas but with quick commerce changing the way people consume and transact, consumers are taking to rapid delivery of food and players like Zepto and Swiggy are trying to capitalise on the trend. “For consumers looking to get food in 10 minutes, it doesn’t matter if the food is coming from Zepto Café or Zomato. For them, Zepto Café is also now an option for ordering their sandwich and samosa. Zepto is playing on the strength of 10-minute delivery. Competition in the food delivery space will increase—ultimately, the money that will be spent on Zepto café will come from the wallet of a Zomato or Swiggy customer,” Satish Meena, advisor at Datum Intelligence told TOI. Zepto competes with Zomato’s Blinkit and Swiggy Instamart in the broader quick commerce market.\\\\nUntil now, consumers could only order café products through the main Zepto app; that option will continue to be available. To be sure, Zepto does not follow a food aggregator model or partner with restaurant brands unlike Zomato and Swiggy. It sources ingredients and ready to eat food items from local vendors and uses a network of kitchens stationed within its dark stores to cook and heat up the products before deliveries. Currently, it offers only a select menu but plans are afoot to broaden it going ahead. “We have speed ovens and coffee machines within our kitchens. It takes us less than two minutes to cook everything in the menu,” a company spokesperson said. In October, Swiggy had launched its 10-minute food delivery offering Bolt; Zomato currently delivers everyday (home made) meals in 15 minutes although industry experts said that the company may also look to push a 10-minute offering into the market soon. Analysts do not completely rule out the possibility of Zepto considering partnering with restaurant brands and offering full-fledged food delivery service like Zomato and Swiggy sometime going ahead. “If the Zepto Café app works, they always have the option of expanding into broader food delivery. Once Zepto Cafe gets customer traffic, restaurants will also be keen on joining them,” said Meena.\\\\nZepto Café operates across 15% of the quick commerce firm’s 600 odd dark stores and is limited to six cities as of now but with the separate app going live next week, the plan is to scale up the offering to cover all dark stores and cities where Zepto operates. “There is a significant consumer top-of-mind advantage to a separate app and we are seeing the economics work standalone. So, a standalone app makes sense,” said Aadit Palicha, co-founder and CEO at Zepto which claims that its café offering sees 30,000 orders per day.\\\\n                \\\\n                The quick commerce battle is rapidly moving into the food space.\\\\nZepto and Blinkit have made moves towards their 10-minute delivery food delivery options on successive days. Yesterday, Zepto had announced Zepto Cafe, which delivered food in 10 minutes. Today, Blinkit appears to have launched an app named Bistro which will similarly deliver food in 10 minutes.\\\\n“We’re launching a separate app for Zepto Café next week!” Zepto CEO Aadit Palicha had posted yesterday on X. “The team is shipping an MVP and iterating quickly, so it may not be perfect on Day 1, but it’s worth it to launch fast 😀 Café is scaling rapidly: we’re launching 100+ Cafés a month and already clocking 30K orders/day,” he had added. Palicha had added a screenshot of the Zepto Cafe app, which seemed to be waiting for approvals on the App store.\\\\nBut Today users discovered that Zepto’s arch rival Blinkit too appears to have launched its 10-minute food delivery app. Named Bistro, the app is already live on the Play Store. It’s already been downloaded over a thousand times, and has a rating of 4.8 after 24 reviews. Bistro says it’ll deliver delicious food in minutes, and offers more than 50 dishes including Adrak Chai, Indori Poha and croissants.\\\\nInterestingly, the third player, Swiggy, already has a 10-minute food delivery app available named Swiggy Bolt. Swiggy Bolt is already available in 400+ cities and towns in India, and delivers over 10 lakh food items through 40,000 participating restaurants. “Designed for speed, Bolt focuses on dishes that can be delivered without compromising on taste, freshness, or quality,” Swiggy had said in a press release last week. Swiggy said that it had partnered with restaurants to optimize order prioritization for Bolt orders, which only had food items with minimum or no preparation time. It had added that delivery partners were not told which orders were ordered through Bolt and which were regular orders to prevent reckless driving — it indicated that Swiggy had optimized the order flow with restaurants to make sure orders reached users in 10 minutes.\\\\nSwiggy, Blinkit and Zepto are each converging on the 10-minute food ordering space from different starting points. Zomato and Swiggy already have large food delivery operations, so they likely already have relationships with restaurants to be able to quickly launch 10-minute food delivery. Zepto doesn’t have a dedicated food ordering arm, but had earlier made snack deliveries available through its main app, so it appears to be extending that with a separate app in Zepto Cafe. All these companies vociferously compete in the quick commerce space, and now appear to be making moves in the 10-minute food delivery space which they clearly seem to believe is ripe for the picking.\\\\nStrategically, it would make the most sense for Zepto to push heavily on food delivery. Zomato and Swiggy will likely cannibalize a portion of their regular orders to 10-minute delivery, but food delivery can be a whole new greenfield operation for Zepto. Additionally, 10-minute food delivery helps all these players stand out from ONDC, which offers food delivery in regular times. These are frenetic times in India’s food delivery space, and with several competitors competing over services, discounts, and delivery timings, the Indian consumer has never had a better chance to have their cake and eat it too.\\\\n                \\\\n                Indian quick commerce upstart Zepto is now rolling out a standalone app for Zepto Cafe, its 10-minute food delivery service. Aadit Palicha, CEO of Zepto, announced the same in a post on X. The standalone app will roll out sometime next week.\\\\n“We’re launching a separate app for Zepto Café next week! The team is shipping an MVP and iterating quickly, so it may not be perfect on Day 1, but it’s worth it to launch fast :D Café is scaling rapidly: we’re launching 100+ Cafés a month and already clocking 30K orders/day 🚀,” the post read.\\\\nWe\\\\\\'re launching a separate app for Zepto Café next week! The team is shipping an MVP and iterating quickly, so it may not be perfect on Day 1, but it\\\\\\'s worth it to launch fast :D\\\\nCafé is scaling rapidly: we\\\\\\'re launching 100+ Cafés a month and already clocking 30K orders/day 🚀 pic.twitter.com/xgbLvj78oe\\\\n— Aadit Palicha (@aadit_palicha) December 11, 2024\\\\nPrior to this development, Zepto Cafe has been a part of the broader Zepto app. Much like the name suggests, it offers multiple and quick food options, ranging from coffee and juices to sandwiches and snacks, all delivered in 10 minutes. Since its inception, the service has experienced impressive growth, with Zepto expanding by over 100 new cafes per month. Currently, Zepto Cafe handles upwards of 30,000 orders daily.\\\\nIn terms of operational scale, Zepto Cafe is currently functioning across about 15% of Zepto’s expansive dark store network, which includes over 600 locations. As the company continues to grow, it plans to expand Zepto Cafe’s coverage to its entire network, which will encompass more than 25 cities in the coming months. Zepto Cafe is currently available for users in several cities across the country, including Gurgaon, Delhi, Bengaluru, and Mumbai.\\\\nThe numbers are in Zepto Cafe’s favour – it has already achieved an annualized revenue run rate (ARR) of ₹160 crore, with projections to reach ₹1,000 crore by 2026. Going forward, the Bengaluru-headquartered firm plans to add new offerings to the menu in a bid to attract a wider range of customers, especially those seeking quick and diverse food options. The company has announced that starting December 16, it will offer 4 million free Vietnamese Cold Coffees as part of a promotional campaign to attract new customers.\\\\nThis begs the question: why is Zepto rolling out a separate app for the service? As mentioned earlier, users could previously access Zepto Cafe through the main Zepto app, alongside other services like groceries and household products. With a dedicated app for the food delivery service, the quick commerce firm will be able to improve visibility and customer engagement for Zepto Cafe, as well as streamline the company’s offerings.\\\\nPalicha cites the “significant consumer top-of-mind advantage” that a standalone app provides as part of the rationale behind this development. “There is a significant consumer top-of-mind advantage to a separate app and we are seeing the economics work stand-alone. So, a stand-alone app makes sense. Users will still be able to order Café products on the main Zepto app,” he said.\\\\n                \\\\n                None\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto Launches New App for 10-Minute Food Delivery: A Game-Changer in Quick Commerce\\\\nNews Synopsis\\\\nIn a move to capitalize on the growing demand for ultra-fast food delivery, Zepto, the quick commerce company known for its lightning-fast deliveries, is set to launch a new standalone app for Zepto Cafe.\\\\nThis new platform, dedicated to the company’s 10-minute food delivery services, will be launched next week, according to a December 11 post by Zepto co-founder and CEO Aadit Palicha.\\\\nThe introduction of the Zepto Cafe app marks a strategic expansion as the company continues to explore new ways to scale its food delivery offerings.\\\\nA Dual-App Strategy: Zepto Cafe and Main Zepto App\\\\nWhile Zepto Cafe will be available through its own app, customers will still have the option to shop for café items like coffee, sandwiches, and more directly through the main Zepto app. This dual-entry approach mirrors a strategy seen earlier with Zomato, which split its services into separate apps, such as Blinkit, to enhance user experience and business performance.\\\\nIndustry analysts have long debated whether food delivery platforms should follow the \"super app\" approach, similar to Swiggy, which consolidates services into one platform, or the \"super brand\" model, adopted by Zomato for different offerings like Blinkit. Zepto’s strategy currently blends elements of both approaches, with a dedicated app for its café offerings and a consolidated main platform for broader services.\\\\nAn industry insider explained the rationale behind this strategy:\\\\n“There is a significant top-of-mind advantage to a separate app and Zepto is seeing the economics work stand-alone. So, a stand-alone app makes sense while also keeping a free channel of acquisition alive on the main Zepto app.”\\\\nRapid Growth of Zepto Cafe and Scaling Plans\\\\nZepto Cafe has been scaling at a remarkable pace. According to Palicha, the company is expanding its café business quickly, launching over 100 cafes a month and already processing more than 30,000 orders daily. The growth of Zepto Cafe is significant, with the company projecting annualized revenue of Rs 160 crore for the segment, which it expects to grow to Rs 1,000 crore in the next few years, by 2026.\\\\nPalicha’s social media update highlighted the success of the venture:\\\\n“Cafe is scaling rapidly: we’re launching 100+ cafes a month and already clocking 30,000 orders per day.”\\\\nCompeting in the 10-Minute Food Delivery Race\\\\nZepto’s latest move comes at a time when the race for 10-minute food delivery is becoming increasingly competitive in India. The market has seen rapid growth, with numerous startups and established companies vying to capitalize on consumer demand for ultra-fast food delivery.\\\\nFor instance, last month, Swish, a new entrant in the rapid food delivery space, raised $2 million from Accel and angel investors to compete with Zepto Cafe, Swiggy’s Bolt, and Zomato’s Everyday. Swiggy Bolt alone accounts for 5 percent of all food delivery orders, indicating the growing market share for these fast food services.\\\\nZomato’s CEO, Deepinder Goyal, and Swiggy’s CEO, Sriharsha Majety, have both emphasized in interviews that 10-minute food deliveries are poised to become the next major frontier in the industry.\\\\nAs consumer expectations evolve and demand for speed intensifies, quick commerce companies like Zepto are increasingly focusing on streamlining their delivery models to stay ahead of the competition.\\\\nZepto’s Long-Term Strategy in Quick Commerce\\\\nZepto’s launch of a dedicated app for Zepto Cafe signals its commitment to building a strong presence in the rapidly growing 10-minute food delivery sector. By combining a separate app for cafe-related services with its core Zepto platform, the company aims to enhance user experience, improve scalability, and ultimately capture a larger share of the market.\\\\nAs the quick commerce landscape evolves, Zepto’s strategic decisions will play a crucial role in defining its position in the competitive food delivery space. Whether other companies follow suit in adopting a dual-app strategy remains to be seen, but Zepto’s move certainly sets the stage for an even more intense battle in India’s fast-paced food delivery sector.\\\\nConclusion:\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s decision to launch a standalone app for its Zepto Cafe offering highlights the company’s commitment to capturing a larger share of the rapidly growing 10-minute food delivery market. By adopting a dual-app strategy, Zepto aims to enhance user experience while maintaining a streamlined approach to its core services.\\\\nThis move comes at a time when competition in the quick commerce sector is intensifying, with both Swiggy and Zomato also expanding their 10-minute food delivery services.\\\\nWith impressive growth in the Zepto Cafe segment, marked by a fast-paced rollout of new cafes and a high volume of daily orders, Zepto is positioning itself as a key player in the evolving quick commerce landscape.\\\\nThe company’s projected revenue growth and commitment to scaling its café offerings signal a bright future for its 10-minute delivery business.\\\\nAs the industry continues to innovate and evolve, Zepto’s strategic approach will likely serve as a model for others looking to capitalize on the growing demand for ultra-fast food delivery in India.\\\\nThe competition between food delivery giants is only expected to escalate, but with a clear focus on consumer demands and operational efficiency, Zepto appears well-positioned to maintain its competitive edge in the 10-minute food delivery race.\\\\nYou May Like\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto to launch a separate app for Zepto Cafe as popularity boosts\\\\nPlans for Zepto Cafe\\\\\\'s separate app come as the offering scale to 30k orders a day and as Zepto adds more than 100 cafes a month.\\\\nQuick commerce unicorn Zepto plans to launch a separate app for Zepto Café next week, according to the company\\\\\\'s Co-Founder and CEO Palicha.\\\\n\"Café is scaling rapidly: we\\\\\\'re launching 100+ Cafés a month and already clocking 30K orders/day,\" stated Co-Founder and CEO Aadit Palicha in a post on X.\\\\nWhile there is a separate tab for Cafe and Super Saver in the Zepto app now, but consumers are still able to place a combined order between cafe items and groceries. There is no clarity on whether this will be possible with the new app.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s plans to launch a separate app for Cafe hint at a broader difference of opinion in the sector. The remaining two bigger players are battling on the merits of Swiggy\\\\\\'s super app strategy against Zomato\\\\\\'s super brands\\\\\\' strategy.\\\\nJust last month, Zepto announced the rollout of its cafe services in major cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru and soon in Hyderabad, Chennai, and Pune.\\\\nIts Cafe, which offers over 148 items, including freshly brewed chai, coffee, all-day breakfast, pastries, and savoury snacks, currently targets a revenue run-rate of Rs 1000 crore by 2026.\\\\nThe company said in November that it is achieving an (estimated) Annual Run Rate (ARR) GMV of Rs 160 crore with just 15% of its expanding dark store network, which has proven unit economics.\\\\nSwiggy\\\\\\'s Bolt, a 10-minute food delivery service, already accounts for 5% of its total food delivery orders, within just two months of its launch. The 10-minute food delivery segment has seen heightened interest with Swiggy\\\\\\'s Bolt and Accel-backed Swish prompting other players like Zomato to offer something similar.\\\\nLast month, Zepto said it crossed Rs 1,000 crore in annualized advertising revenue, amounting to Rs 83 crore per month\\\\nJust a day ago, the company\\\\\\'s Chief Human Resources Officer Martin Dinesh Gomez left the role amid \\\\\\'toxic work culture\\\\\\' at the startup.\\\\nEdited by Affirunisa Kankudti\\\\n                \\\\n                Quick commerce platform Zepto will launch a separate app for Zepto Cafe, its 10-minute food delivery service, next week, CEO Aadit Palicha announced on December 11.\\\\nZepto Cafe will have its own app, but customers can also order coffee, sandwiches, and more through the main Zepto app.\\\\n“We\\\\\\'re launching a separate app for Zepto Café next week!

Looking ahead, the market is anticipated to experience substantial growth and is projected to reach $37.0 billion by 2028. This growth trajectory indicates a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31.3% during the period from 2023 to 2028.\\\\nThe sector has expanded in prevalence in the past few years as a result of evolving customer habits, growing urbanization, and a tech-savvy generation that prefers to make online purchases.\\\\nAs per RedSeer, India\\\\\\'s quick commerce market is set for impressive growth, projected to expand by 10–15 times by 2025 and reach a market size of nearly $5.5 billion. This substantial growth is expected to surpass other markets, including China, in terms of quick commerce adoption.\\\\nAs their standard of living increases and their daily schedules get tighter, consumers are flocking to customized and convenient internet platforms for grocery shopping instead of walking down to the local shops.\\\\nFollowing the COVID-19 pandemic, the popularity of online grocery delivery became increasingly evident. As a consequence of social distancing constraints, consumers are converting to online grocery shopping, which is not only convenient but also safer.\\\\nZepto - Founders and Team\\\\nAadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, both 19-year-old childhood pals, founded Zepto after walking out of Stanford University\\\\\\'s renowned computer science department to return to their home country, India, and start up a business. The Zepto company began its operations in April 2021.\\\\nKaivalya Vohra\\\\nKaivalya Vohra is the CTO and Co-Founder of Zepto. He was also the founder and CTO of KiranaKart. He also attended Stanford University to pursue a degree in Computer Science, but like Aadit, he decided to leave the university. Kaivalya, along with Aadit, participated in Y Combinator as well.\\\\nAadit Palicha\\\\nAadit Palicha is the CEO and Co-Founder of Zepto. He was also the founder and CEO of KiranaKart. After completing an IB diploma from GEMS Education in Mathematics and Computer Science, Palicha then went for a Bachelor\\\\\\'s degree in Computer Science from Stanford University, however, he quit the program in the middle to launch his firm. Aadit then completed Y Combinator Grade: W21 and started with PryvaSee as a Project Lead. Aadit Palicha then founded GoPool, his first startup, when he was just 17. He left the same in April 2020 and founded KiranaKart and then Zepto.\\\\nFlaunt your startup with StartupTalky\\\\n800+ stories, thousands of founders, and millions of visitors.

Inviting founders and startups who are building sustainable solutions from ground zero! Startups who run the show, StartupTalky will let the world know!\\\\nZepto - Startup Story\\\\nMany of us have \"startup ideas,\" but even the most creative among us struggle to see them through. Palicha and Vohra had both enrolled at Stanford to earn a Computer Science degree but had dropped out to follow their business passions instead.\\\\nThe story of Zepto started during the COVID-19 outbreak. The concept for Zepto sprang from the limitations of their houses. A surge in demand for delivery services meant that groceries and other necessities would arrive in a couple of days, creating a void for quick delivery. As a result, Zepto was created with all this insight.\\\\nThese teenagers were abruptly detained, because of Covid norms, detained in their Mumbai homes after significant collaboration on many projects, including a ride-hailing commuting app for kids. Even while grocery delivery, which was deemed important by local authorities, was still permitted across much of the nation as the virus spread, the duo battled to get their provisions as the illness expanded.\\\\nWhile Zepto is the focus of attention, Palicha and Vohra\\\\\\'s first venture, KiranaKart, did not receive the same acclaim. Zepto, on the other hand, is inspired by KiranaKart. KiranaKart, as its name implies, was a supermarket delivery service. It had made arrangements with Kirana merchants to provide groceries in 45 minutes or less. A $730,000 pre-seed round was led by Global Founders Capital, 2 AM Ventures, Contrary Capital, and angel investors. At the time, Vohra and Palicha planned to make the first 1.5 lakh deliveries for INR 1.\\\\nZepto - Mission and Vision\\\\nAs two bachelors living alone, the founders found it most difficult to obtain food, therefore, they focused their applications on grocery delivery. So, whereas KiranaKart, their first startup, tried to make grocery delivery easier for Kiranas, Zepto aims to shorten delivery times.\\\\nZepto - Name, Logo, and Tagline\\\\nThe firm, which uses the term \"Zepto\" to denote \"a factor of 10⁻²¹, i.e. 0.000000000000000000001,\" named after a minuscule unit of time, offers a 10-minute grocery delivery service, surpassing numerous well-funded competitors.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s tagline says, \"Groceries delivered in 10 minutes\".\\\\nZepto - Business and Revenue Model\\\\nZepto delivers groceries in ten minutes through a system of dark storefronts and mini-warehouses, on up to 90% of orders. Zepto works in the quick commerce segment of India. It is designed to be customer-centric and built around the instant service model.\\\\nTo ensure a flawless delivery experience, Aadit says that their average delivery time is 8 minutes and 47 seconds. Through a chain of dark stores or retail distribution centers, the Mumbai-based company employs a hotspot method to cater largely to digital purchases.\\\\nA dark store is a tiny neighborhood storehouse that customers cannot visit but purchase online to get packaged delivery. While dark stores are not new to the Indian industry, Aadit believes that the idea has yet to be completely explored. Population, traffic dynamics, topography, road patterns, weather conditions, last-mile operational improvement, real estate prices, and other geographic data and local intelligence aid Zepto in optimizing its connectivity. Furthermore, the startup\\\\\\'s dark warehouses and cool rooms are custom-designed to satisfy particular criteria such as ease of travel, allowing packers to move as swiftly as possible to fill orders.\\\\nLocation intelligence and geographic data, such as topography, population, road patterns, traffic dynamics, weather, last-mile supply availability, real estate values, and so on, are said to help Zepto optimize its network.\\\\nZepto - Funding and Investors\\\\nZepto, the Mumbai-based quick commerce unicorn, achieved unicorn status in August 2023 after raising $200 million in a Series E funding round, which brought its valuation to $1.4 billion. This milestone marked the end of India\\\\\\'s 11-month unicorn drought. The Series E round was led by The StepStone Group, with participation from Goodwater Capital and existing investors.\\\\nIn June 2024, Zepto raised $665 million, which valued the company at $3.6 billion. Just a few months later, on August 30, 2024, Zepto raised $340 million in Series G funding, which increased its valuation to $5 billion. The Series G round was led by General Catalyst, with Dragon Fund and Epiq Capital joining as new investors. Existing backers such as StepStone, Lightspeed, DST, and Contrary also increased their investments, reflecting strong confidence in Zepto\\\\\\'s growth potential.\\\\nIn November 2024, Zepto raised another $350 million from a group of domestic investors, led by Motilal Oswal\\\\\\'s private wealth division, at a flat valuation of $5 billion. This brings the total funding raised by Zepto to $2 billion.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s initial seed funding in September 2020 was led by Contrary.\\\\n| Date | Round | Amount | Lead Investors |\\\\n|---|---|---|---|\\\\n| November 21, 2024 | Series G | $350 | Motilal Oswal Wealth |\\\\n| August 30, 2024 | Series G | $340 million | General Catalyst, Mars Growth Capital |\\\\n| June 21, 2024 | Series F | $665 million | Glade Brook Capital Partners, Nexus Venture Partners, StepStone Group |\\\\n| Nov 8, 2023 | Series E | $31.3 million | Goodwater Capital, Nexus Venture Partners |\\\\n| Aug 25, 2023 | Series E | $200 million | StepStone Group |\\\\n| May 2, 2022 | Series D | $200 million | Y Combinator Continuity Fund |\\\\n| Dec 20, 2021 | Series C | $100 million | Y Combinator Continuity Fund |\\\\n| Oct 31, 2021 | Series B | $60 million | Glade Brook Capital Partners |\\\\n| Mar 22, 2021 | Series A | $6.5 million | Nexus Venture Partners |\\\\n| Sep 1, 2020 | Pre Seed Round | - | Contrary |\\\\nZepto - Shareholding\\\\nZepto shareholding pattern as of October 2024 (source: Tracxn):\\\\n| Zepto Shareholders | Percentage |\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n| Aadit Palicha | 0.9% |\\\\n| Kaivalya Vohra | 0.7% |\\\\n| Nexus Venture Partners | 18.6% |\\\\n| Glade Brook Capital | 10.3% |\\\\n| StepStone Group | 9.8% |\\\\n| Y Combinator | 8.7% |\\\\n| LGF Scale I | 7.8% |\\\\n| Rocket Internet | 3.0% |\\\\n| General Catalyst | 4.1% |\\\\n| Goodwater Capital | 1.8% |\\\\n| Razor\\\\\\'s Edge Ventures | 1.6% |\\\\n| Contrary | 1.6% |\\\\n| Kaiser Permanente | 2.3% |\\\\n| avra | 1.3% |\\\\n| SpringBlue Capital | 1.0% |\\\\n| Lightspeed Venture Partners | 0.8% |\\\\n| Global Founders Capital | 0.8% |\\\\n| Crimson | 0.5% |\\\\n| Vanderbilt University | 0.3% |\\\\n| Mangum | 0.3% |\\\\n| Bayhouse Capital | 0.2% |\\\\n| Mehta Ventures | <0.1% |\\\\n| Contrary Capital | <0.1% |\\\\n| Zpt Holdings | 2.1% |\\\\n| AZ04 | 1.4% |\\\\n| Kiranakart SPV | 0.6% |\\\\n| Sayacorps | 0.4% |\\\\n| C Opportunities | 0.1% |\\\\n| Jung Lish Lee | 2.3% |\\\\n| Oliver Jung | 0.7% |\\\\n| Oleg Wladimir Nicolas Tscheltzoff | 0.2% |\\\\n| Aditi Javesh Jhaveri | <0.1% |\\\\n| Manoj Chawla | <0.1% |\\\\n| Kavit Dilip Palicha | 8.0% |\\\\n| Jaideep Vohra | 6.7% |\\\\n| Other Investors | 1.0% |\\\\nAmong the shareholders, Nexus Venture Partners holds the largest stake, holding 18.6% of Zepto. Other prominent owners of Zepto include Y Combinator, Glade Brook Capital, StepStone Group, and co-founders Aadit Palicha (along with Kavit Dilip Palicha) and Kaivalya Vohra (along with Jaideep Vohra), among others.\\\\nZepto - IPO\\\\nZepto plans to go public in 2025. To prepare for its IPO, the company set up a new entity, Zepto Marketplace Private Limited, in October 2024 to simplify its operations. Zepto currently operates under a B2B model, sourcing products directly from brands and selling them to its partner companies, which then distribute the products to customers under a licensing agreement.\\\\nIn January 2025, Zepto completed its domicile shift from Singapore to India ahead of its IPO, which is now expected to raise between $800 million and $1 billion, including secondaries. Initially, the company targeted a $450 million primary capital raise.\\\\nZepto has hired Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Axis Capital as advisors for the IPO. This marks a key step in its journey as a leader in the quick commerce industry.\\\\nZepto - Growth and Revenue\\\\nZepto has seen impressive growth, serving 10 major cities with 1,000+ employees. They deliver more than 5,000 products, revolutionizing the Indian grocery segment with 10-minute delivery, advanced tech, and optimized centers.\\\\nEngineering, operations, marketing, and financial positions are also available at Zepto. Palicha claims that month-over-month growth is 200%, with a monthly retention rate of 78%.\\\\n“We are looking at a pretty crazy runrate,” he said. “In the past one and a half months, we have grown our business by 10 times. And now we are working to grow another 10 times by February or March,” said Palicha in December 2021.\\\\nZepto, when it was a five-month-old startup, had secured a valuation of $570 million after raising $100 million in a Series C round headed by Y Combinator\\\\\\'s Continuity Fund, which was a 2X increase from its previous valuation of $60 million only 45 days before that. Zepto raised another round led by Y Combinator to lift its valuation further to $900 million, so there is certainly impressive growth that the company has received in funding as well.\\\\nAnother positive development for Zepto has been the expertise it has been able to acquire. Plenty of well-known senior executives from Uber, Flipkart, Dream11, Amazon, and Pharmeasy have joined the team.\\\\nAccording to Palicha, one of the reasons why several entrepreneurs have chosen Zepto is that it has enabled individuals who had transferred from Mumbai to Bangalore to come back to their homes. He says, nevertheless, that the startup\\\\\\'s rapid development, rigorous execution, and ambitions have captivated others who share his interests. \"We\\\\\\'ve been able to walk the walk,\" he said.\\\\n“They originally launched with a different model, swiftly pivoted to quick commerce in August 2021 and are now adding 100,000 new customers every week, 60% of them women. Their attention to detail on the logistics experience is unparalleled and this has enabled them to scale to most major metros in just 5 months. Simply put, we’re confident Zepto will win in this space over the long-term,\" said Anu Hariharan, a partner at Y Combinator, in a statement.\\\\nZepto has demonstrated significant growth in recent times, with the majority of its dark stores now operating profitably. According to co-founder and CEO Aadit Palicha, Zepto has successfully established its presence in major metro cities in India with over 300-400 dark stores. Impressively, approximately 50–60 percent of these dark stores have started generating cash flows, indicating the effectiveness of Zepto\\\\\\'s business model and operational strategies. This noteworthy achievement highlights Zepto\\\\\\'s commitment to sustainable growth and profitability in the fiercely competitive quick-commerce industry.\\\\nZepto Financials\\\\n| Zepto Financials | FY22 | FY23 | FY24 |\\\\n|---|---|---|---|\\\\n| Operating Revenue | INR 142.3 crore | INR 2,026 crore | INR 4,454 crore |\\\\n| Expenses | INR 532.7 crore | INR 3,350 crore | INR 5,754 crore |\\\\n| Profit/Loss | INR 390.3 crore (loss) | INR 1,272 crore (loss) | INR 1,248 crore (loss) |\\\\nIn FY23, the quick-commerce startup’s operating revenue stood at INR 2,026 crore.

The company also reported a 140% year-on-year growth, with 75% of its dark stores achieving full EBITDA positivity by May 2024.\\\\nZepto - Challenges\\\\nZepto has encountered some challenges lately, and in one of the recent ones, there were instances of founder and investor impropriety within the quick commerce delivery startup. Ansh Nanda, an alleged co-founder of the startup said that he was forced to relinquish his stakes in the startup by the other cofounders and by Nexus Ventures. This was carried forward by Nanda, who lodged an FIR against the cofounders of Zepto and the Nexus Ventures partner, Suvir Sujan. However, the co-founders responded to the same without much delay by approaching the Delhi High Court. Zepto is the third startup that is backed by Nexus and where one of the co-founders has been named in an FIR. YoloBus and Acko were two other companies that dealt with the same before.\\\\nZepto - Advertisements and Social Media Campaigns\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s marketing strategy has been a key driver of its rapid growth in the quick-commerce industry. The creative brilliance of L&K Saatchi & Saatchi was evident in three earlier ads promoting Zepto\\\\\\'s products and services.\\\\nBuilding on this success, Zepto continued to impress with new campaigns featuring celebrated singers like Kailash Kher, Shankar Mahadevan, and Usha Uthup during the IPL season of 2022. These unique and melodic campaigns resonated with audiences, boosting Zepto\\\\\\'s visibility and brand appeal.\\\\nFurthermore, the launch of the \"Nahi Milega\" campaign in March 2023, featuring the character \"Uncle Ji,\" highlighted unlimited free deliveries, solidifying Zepto\\\\\\'s position as the go-to platform for ultra-fast and cost-effective grocery delivery. With an innovative approach and successful marketing initiatives, Zepto has emerged as a leading player in the competitive quick-commerce industry, catering to the needs of time-conscious consumers.\\\\nZepto - Competitors\\\\nMany businesses compete with Zepto and have already been driving fast-paced delivery of groceries like:\\\\n- Swiggy Instamart\\\\n- Blinkit\\\\n- Big Basket\\\\nDunzo is another startup, that uses its Xpress Mart dark shop network to deliver groceries in Bengaluru in 19 minutes and competes with Zepto.\\\\nZepto - Future Plans\\\\nZepto currently operates in major cities across India, including Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Ghaziabad, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, and Kolkata. The company has ambitious plans to multiply its dark stores and expand its delivery network with profitability in focus.\\\\nZepto has sped up its store expansion, increasing its target from 700 to 1,200 stores by March 2025. With over 650 outlets in operation as of January 2025, the company is strengthening its presence in the quick commerce space.\\\\nA new key driver of Zepto’s growth is its food and beverage division, Zepto Café, which is currently in 15% of its dark stores. With an estimated ARR of INR 160 crore, Zepto Café is expanding rapidly, adding over 100 outlets monthly and targeting an INR 1,000 crore revenue run rate by FY26.\\\\nThe company is projecting gross sales of $5.5 billion in the final quarter of FY26, with an aim to achieve positive EBITDA (excluding ESOPs).\\\\nThe ultimate goal is to become a publicly listed company.

We will be able to meet that,” said Thiagarajan, adding that Bluestar expects to sell approximately 1.75 million units of room ACs in FY26.\\\\nOn Thursday, Bluestar introduced 150 new models as part of its expansion strategy. A significant portion of this growth is expected to come from tier-III, IV, and V markets, as more middle-class consumers aspire to own air conditioners.\\\\n“It is actually the middle-class aspirational consumers who are beginning to buy,” said Thiagarajan. “Now it is also evident from the fact that this year, for example, Bluestar’s 40 per cent sale will be through consumer finance.”\\\\nCurrently, over 65 percent of Bluestar’s sales come from smaller towns, while demand in metro cities is also on the rise, particularly as more consumers invest in second or third air conditioners for their homes.\\\\nTo meet the growing demand, Bluestar is expanding its production capacity. “Last year, the capacity was around 1.5 million, and it will go up to 1.7 million. Still, we do buy some two lakh units from outside. So, the intention is next year, to take the capacity to 1.75 million,” said Thiagarajan.\\\\nThe Indian room AC market is estimated to have surpassed 15 million units in FY25, with an anticipated growth of 25-30 percent in the next fiscal year.\\\\nThe increasing exposure to air-conditioned environments in restaurants, metro railways, cars, airports, and offices is playing a key role in shaping consumer behavior, leading to higher demand for home ACs.\\\\n“The growth is all around and this is the only category which is growing. There are many other categories which are stagnant or not growing,” Thiagarajan explained. “Now people’s priority is to get an air conditioner. In a typical Indian home, people buy for either their parents’ comfort or children’s comfort. And so, the next 10 years, such growth should continue.”\\\\nWith a 14 percent share in India\\\\\\'s room AC market, Bluestar competes with Voltas, LG Electronics, Hitachi, Godrej Appliances, Panasonic, Haier, and others. Despite the competition, the company remains optimistic about sustained growth.\\\\nThiagarajan also emphasized that domestic value addition in AC manufacturing is set to increase, supported by the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, which is fostering a stronger component ecosystem for air conditioners in India.\\\\nPret A Manger has reached a significant global milestone with the launch of its first-ever full-service dine-in store at Phoenix Mall of the Millennium, Pune.

The move aligns with Zepto’s broader strategy to strengthen its retail presence in India before going public.\\\\nThe private equity divisions of Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. and Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd. are in talks to acquire shares in the secondary sale, according to sources familiar with the matter.

The survey, conducted by IPSOS, was presented by Chirag Paswan, Union Minister for Food Processing Industry, at an event focused on the industry\\\\\\'s development.\\\\nThe report highlights the regional distribution of sales, with the northern region leading at 29.8 percent, followed by the East (24.2 percent), West (22.4 percent), South (15.3 percent), and Northeast (8.3 percent). Maharashtra accounted for the highest sales share at 13 percent, followed by West Bengal (11.3 percent), Uttar Pradesh (10 percent), Bihar (6.2 percent), and Karnataka (5.7 percent). Wellness and nutraceutical products contributed 64.15 percent of total sales, while cosmetics and personal care made up 23.75 percent, and household goods accounted for 3.1 percent. These three categories collectively represent 91 percent of total direct sales in India’s retail sector.\\\\nThe number of active direct sellers has also risen, reaching 88 lakh compared to 86 lakh in the previous year. Women now make up 44 percent of the total direct seller workforce, an increase from 37 percent in FY 2022-23, reflecting the growing presence of women entrepreneurs in the industry.\\\\nAddressing the event, Paswan acknowledged the direct selling industry’s contribution to self-employment and job creation.

The growth trajectory of the industry has been on a surge over the years. A CAGR of 7.15 percent is a testament to the fact that direct selling businesses in the country have made steady growth and are poised to strengthen further in the years to come on the back of a promising regulatory framework by the government for the industry.”\\\\nThe industry’s sustained expansion, coupled with regulatory support, indicates a positive outlook for direct selling in India\\\\\\'s retail sector.\\\\nRetail businesses in India\\\\\\'s liquor sector are looking to the new government in Delhi for policy changes that would create a level playing field for domestic premium liquor brands competing with imported products. Industry experts believe this could improve access to Indian-made single-malt whiskies, wines, and gins in the capital.\\\\nCurrently, the excise policy in Delhi imposes a high brand-license fee, which has kept many domestic liquor manufacturers out of the market. Industry representatives argue that revising these regulations would enable consumers to access a wider range of locally produced premium alcoholic beverages.\\\\nWith policy changes, Indian liquor brands could gain a stronger presence in Delhi\\\\\\'s retail market, allowing them to compete more effectively with global counterparts while expanding consumer choices in the capital.\\\\nRetail brand Perona, known for its modern minimalism and craftsmanship in India’s luxury fashion market, has brought on board Paul, a designer with over two decades of experience in European fashion.

All our efforts in communicating the store launch led to this moment of truth—seeing a sea of customers waiting outside, ready to step in as soon as we opened,” said Shikhar Srivastava, Brand Manager at M&S India, in a LinkedIn post.\\\\nM&S entered the Indian market in 2001 and later formed a joint venture with Reliance Retail in 2008 under Marks and Spencer Reliance India Private Limited.\\\\nWith the latest store opening, M&S now operates more than 107 stores across 33 cities in India, as per the company’s official website. According to its LinkedIn page, the retailer has over 1,900 employees supporting its online and offline operations.\\\\nHeadquartered in Paddington, London, M&S was established in 1884 by Michael Marks and Thomas Spencer in Leeds. As of 2023, the company operates more than 1,064 stores in the UK and over 452 stores globally, according to Statista. Across its worldwide operations, M&S employs over 66,000 people, with a majority being women.\\\\nHaier Appliances India is setting ambitious targets to achieve USD 2 billion in sales within the next three to four years, driven by strong double-digit growth. This growth will be fueled by product category expansion and increased market penetration.\\\\nTo support this expansion, the home appliances manufacturer has allocated over Rs. 1,000 crore between 2024 and 2028 for setting up new air-conditioner production and injection molding units. This investment follows the Rs. 2,400 crore already infused into its Pune and Greater Noida plants.\\\\nWith the establishment of the new plant, Haier India’s production capacity will rise from 1.5 million units to 4 million units annually, significantly enhancing domestic value addition.\\\\n“Currently we have a capacity of 1.5 million. However, the way the AC market is growing here, by 2027 we will have a shortage in capacity. … The new plant will be 2.5 million units,” stated NS Satish, President, Haier Appliances India.\\\\nThe company is also considering setting up a manufacturing facility in South India, with investment details to be announced soon. While specifics were not disclosed, Satish indicated that the investment would be comparable in scale and capacity to the Noida Industrial Park facility.\\\\nIn 2024, Haier reported a 36 percent increase in revenue, reaching approximately Rs. 8,900 crore and surpassing the USD 1 billion sales milestone. For the current year, the company anticipates revenue exceeding Rs. 11,500 crore.\\\\n“And subsequent to that, every year, we are looking around Rs 2,000 to 2,500 crore plus. So we have big plans. And we see a big opportunity in India. When you see the economy GDP, which is doing very well, next is the penetration of the product, which is very low when we compare it to our global counterparts,” Satish further added.\\\\nWhen asked about the timeline for achieving USD 2 billion in sales, Satish responded, “In the next three to four years, definitely. We are already a USD 1 billion company. I think in the next three to four years, we will definitely surpass USD 2 billion.”\\\\nHaier sees significant potential in product categories such as air-conditioners, refrigerators, washing machines, TV panels, and commercial freezers, given the lower market penetration in India compared to other nations. India is currently the fourth-largest market for the China-based Haier Group Corporation. However, Satish envisions India securing a place among Haier’s top three markets globally within the next four to five years, contributing USD 2 billion in revenue. At present, China, North America, and a combined Russia-Europe market lead Haier Group’s global sales.\\\\n“India has two sides of the story. One is looking for more and more premium products, and the ones who are looking for a value for money product. That’s where we manufacture even a single-door refrigerator. And also, recently, we have introduced the four-door, the most premium refrigerators in India, even the air conditioner. So we see opportunity on both sides, in the entry as well as in the premium segment also,” explained Satish.\\\\nDespite this balanced approach, Haier’s primary growth in the past year has been driven by the premium category. Various affordability-enhancing schemes, such as easy EMI options, have contributed to this trend.\\\\nWhen asked if Haier plans to introduce its global brands in India’s growing premium market, Satish clarified, “We still have a huge scope for developing Haier products at this point. We will continue to invest in building the Haier brand and expanding our product portfolio. At this point, we have not thought about bringing in any global brands.”\\\\nHaier Group’s portfolio includes well-known brands such as Haier, Casarte, Leader, GE Appliances, Fisher & Paykel, AQUA, and Candy.\\\\nSwiss premium coffee brand Nespresso has made its official entry into the Indian retail market with the launch of its first boutique at Nexus Select Citywalk in Saket, Delhi. This expansion marks a significant step in the brand’s strategy to tap into India’s growing premium coffee market, with further retail growth planned in the coming years, as shared in a social media announcement.\\\\n“Nespresso expands into India with Delhi flagship. Swiss coffee specialist targets growing premium market with first Indian boutique at Nexus Select Citywalk at Saket. A Vision, a Journey and a Partnership. Thankful to get this opportunity to work on India’s first Nespresso Boutique, I remember seeing the boutique on George Street, Sydney over a decade back and making a wish to bring and work on this brand for their India Entry and here we are,” said Sakshi Goel, Associate Executive Director, CBRE.\\\\nNespresso has been sourcing high-quality green coffee from India since 2011, incorporating Indian coffee into nearly one in five of its global blends. The brand works directly with approximately 2,000 coffee farmers in Karnataka, ensuring that premium-quality beans are used in its signature capsules.\\\\nCurrently, Nespresso imports its coffee capsules from Switzerland, with a pack of 10 capsules priced at Rs. 950 and a pack of 50 available for Rs. 4,750. The company is also closely assessing tariffs and pricing strategies, particularly in light of the recently signed free trade agreement between India and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), of which Switzerland is a member.\\\\nWith India\\\\\\'s coffee culture evolving rapidly and premium coffee gaining popularity, Nespresso’s retail entry comes at a strategic time, appealing to an audience that seeks high-quality, barista-style coffee at home. The company’s expansion into India reflects its long-term vision to cater to a growing base of coffee aficionados, further strengthening its presence in the global market.\\\\nPepsiCo has set an ambitious target to double its revenue in India within the next five years, identifying the country as a crucial growth market. The company is making significant investments to expand its capacity and strengthen its presence in India, according to Jagrut Kotecha, CEO of PepsiCo India & South Asia.\\\\nIndia plays a key role in PepsiCo’s global revenue strategy, ranking among the company’s top three markets for food, snacks, and beverages. PepsiCo has already established greenfield plants in Uttar Pradesh and Assam to keep up with growing demand. The company plans to continue investing heavily and is set to open two more facilities, including one in southern India.\\\\n“We believe India will be the engine of growth for PepsiCo to drive the top line. Yes, it’s not as big as North America because it is a lot more evolved category. Our per capita consumption in India is still very low, not only for us on beverage and food, but we would expect one of PepsiCo’s fastest growing economies to do that,” stated Kotecha, CEO, PepsiCo India.\\\\nThe company considers India to be one of its 13 to 15 key anchor markets for global expansion, citing the country’s economic stability and growth potential. Kotecha emphasized that PepsiCo aligns with India’s vision for economic development by 2030, describing it as one of the most stable economies with strong growth fundamentals.\\\\n“It’s one of the most stable economies, growth engine, etc, and hence, PepsiCo also has been in this country for almost 30 years, good, strong, fundamentals. So, we need to double that, dial that up and start investing. We have been investing, but continue to aggressively invest to ensure that we also take that opportunity,” added Kotecha.\\\\nPepsiCo recently reported robust double-digit organic revenue growth in India, with increased market share in both the savory snacks and beverage segments. While Kotecha did not disclose a specific timeline for achieving the USD 2 billion revenue milestone, he reiterated the company’s aspiration to reach that figure.\\\\nIn 2023, PepsiCo reported revenue of approximately Rs 5,950 crore for a nine-month period due to a financial year transition. When extrapolated to a full year, the revenue would be around Rs 8,200 crore. Its bottling partner, Varun Beverages, which accounts for 90 percent of PepsiCo India’s beverage sales volume, reported standalone revenue of Rs 12,778.96 crore in 2023.\\\\nOver the past three years, PepsiCo has invested close to Rs 3,500-4,000 crore in India, reinforcing its long-term commitment to the market. Its bottling partner, Varun Beverages Ltd (VBL), has also been making significant investments, operating 41 plants and expanding capacity by 25 percent this year.\\\\nRegarding market competition, Kotecha welcomed the entry of new players like Reliance’s Campa Cola, which has disrupted the market with aggressive pricing and distributor margins.\\\\nIn 2023, approximately 80 percent of PepsiCo India’s revenue came from its food division, with the remaining 20 percent from beverages. The Indian beverage market, valued at around USD 12 billion, is currently growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10-11 percent.\\\\nWith strong financial growth, ongoing market expansion, and continued investments, PepsiCo remains dedicated to strengthening its position in India and capitalizing on the country’s economic potential.\\\\nDavaindia, one of India’s leading generic medicine retail chains, has unveiled its strategic plans to widen its reach across Kerala, ensuring healthcare remains both accessible and affordable.

Leveraging its established presence in the gold industry, the company aims to address the growing demand for ethical and sustainable diamonds.\\\\nLab-grown diamonds are gaining traction as an alternative to mined diamonds, with the global market projected to reach $1.2 billion by 2033. In India, the industry lacks established players, creating an opportunity for Augmont to expand its offerings.\\\\nKetan Kothari, Director, Augmont said, \"Augmont\\\\\\'s vision is very clear - we want to be the leading lab-grown diamond jewellery brand in India. LGD is the future for a nation like India where jewellery has many meanings - aspirations, emotions, and culture. The penetration of mined diamond jewelry in India is less than 5 percent whereas 95 percent of consumers want to own diamonds. Mined diamonds have given negative returns and hence they are not an investment for Indian consumers, who are the smartest when it comes to value investments. Large jewellery chains are in a dilemma to enter this space because of the fact that they have been selling mined diamond jewelry for years and it will be a hard sell for the consumers. Other brands that have entered the space are largely start-ups which have to build trust and credibility which takes years. Augmont\\\\\\'s foray into jewellery could not be better timed. Customers trust us for the transparency, innovation, and the fact that we always offer buyback for all our gold products and now LGD jewelry too!\"\\\\nAugmont plans to introduce Akoirah with a focus on pricing, design, and trust. \"The math is simple - whatever money that you save in terms of the difference between mined diamonds and LGDs, invest the same in gold. The appreciation in gold prices will more than make up for the investments in LGD even if for argument\\\\\\'s sake, LGD prices don\\\\\\'t increase! Added to that, you get better designs and quality. We are bringing the same commitment to purity, value, and excellence that has defined Augmont’s gold legacy into the world of fine diamond jewellery,\" added Ketan Kothari.\\\\nNamita Kothari, Founder of Akoirah added, \"Akoirah is all about making Love-Grown Diamonds attainable for all. We believe that fine jewellery should be both aspirational and accessible. Through innovative craftsmanship, and unbeatable gold rates, we are crafting jewellery that is not just beautiful, but meaningful.\"\\\\nAugmont aims to integrate its expertise in gold pricing, purity, and recycling into the LGD segment. Akoirah will feature 100 percent recycled gold and responsibly sourced lab-grown diamonds, ensuring sustainability without compromising on quality. The company also plans to use advanced technology to provide certified, high-quality diamonds at competitive prices. Additionally, customers will be offered a 100 percent exchange and buyback value.\\\\nThe expansion strategy includes an omni-channel approach, leveraging Augmont’s existing digital gold consumer base. With prices starting at Rs 5,000, Akoirah aims to cater to a broad audience. The company plans to establish 100 stores across India, providing both online and offline retail access.\\\\nThrough Akoirah, Augmont is positioning itself as a key player in the evolving jewellery market, aligning with the increasing demand for ethical and sustainable diamond options in India.\\\\nVivienne Westwood is set to present its first-ever fashion show in India, showcasing a collection at Mumbai’s Gateway of India.

The announcement led to a 14 percent drop in its shares.\\\\nThe apparel retailer warned that profit margins would be under pressure due to higher freight costs and increased promotional activities early in the year to clear surplus inventory. Additionally, the company highlighted a $5 million impact from U.S. tariffs, adding another challenge to its financial outlook.\\\\nCEO Fran Horowitz addressed the shift in consumer spending patterns during a post-earnings call, stating that spring demand had returned to a \"more normalized\" pace this year. She noted a decline in sales for the A&F brand, mirroring Target’s (TGT.N) concerns over weak apparel sales in February.\\\\nWilliam Blair, analyst, Dylan Carden weighed in on the earnings report, expressing concern over the company\\\\\\'s performance, saying, \"The initial print does not sow confidence.\" He further cautioned that while A&F brand sales had grown by 2 percent during the holiday quarter, they could be on a downward trajectory, potentially jeopardizing Abercrombie\\\\\\'s full-year targets.\\\\nAbercrombie & Fitch has projected annual net sales growth between 3 percent and 5 percent, falling short of market expectations, which had anticipated a 6.77 percent increase, according to LSEG data.\\\\nAcross the retail industry, major players like Walmart (WMT.N) and Home Depot (HD.N) have set their annual targets conservatively, as persistent inflation pressures American consumers to cut back on discretionary spending, including apparel, home furnishings, and electronics. Adding to the uncertainty is the potential economic fallout from tariffs on imported goods, a policy concern that continues to weigh on shoppers\\\\\\' confidence.\\\\nFor fiscal 2025, Abercrombie expects an operating margin between 14 percent and 15 percent, factoring in the impact of tariffs on imports from China, Canada, and Mexico. This marks a slight dip from the 15 percent margin recorded in the previous fiscal year. The company sources 5 percent to 6 percent of its merchandise from China, while its exposure to Mexican imports remains \"immaterial,\" according to executives.\\\\nAbercrombie\\\\\\'s 2023 annual report reveals that the company imports 34 percent of its products from Vietnam, with Cambodia and India among its top sourcing regions.\\\\nDespite the cautious outlook, holiday quarter results surpassed expectations. The company reported $1.58 billion in net sales, driven by a 16 percent sales increase in its teen-focused Hollister brand. Adjusted earnings per share stood at $3.57, slightly exceeding analyst estimates of $3.54. For the full year, Abercrombie projects earnings between $10.40 and $11.40 per share, marginally above market forecasts.\\\\nCopyright © 2009 - 2025 Franchiseindia.com Ltd\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto, the quick-commerce unicorn revolutionizing 10-minute deliveries in India, has reported a remarkable 120% jump in its revenue for FY24, reaching ₹4,455 crore. This significant growth underscores the rising preference of customers for quick deliveries over traditional e-commerce platforms and kirana stores. Despite increased operational costs, Zepto managed to reduce its losses marginally by 2%, signaling a strong trajectory toward profitability.\\\\nRevenue Boom Outpaces Competitors\\\\nZepto has cemented its leadership in the quick commerce segment with a revenue far ahead of its competitors. In FY24:\\\\n– Zepto: ₹4,455 crore\\\\n– Blinkit (market leader): ₹2,301 crore\\\\n– Swiggy Instamart: ₹1,100 crore\\\\nZepto’s dominance in revenue terms highlights its ability to capture a growing customer base transitioning to faster delivery options. CEO and co-founder Aadit Palicha emphasized the company’s robust growth on LinkedIn, stating, “Our accounting revenue has grown 120% year-on-year… Even with 120% growth, our absolute losses came down year-on-year with PAT as a percentage of revenue improving from -63% in FY23 to -28% in FY24.”\\\\nRising Costs and Controlled Losses\\\\nZepto’s phenomenal growth has come at a price. The company’s total expenses surged by 72% to ₹5,747 crore in FY24, up from ₹3,350 crore in FY23. This sharp increase is attributed to high marketing expenses, the cost of materials, and investments in logistics and operations to support its aggressive expansion.\\\\nDespite these expenses, Zepto managed to reduce its losses marginally from ₹1,272 crore in FY23 to ₹1,249 crore in FY24. The improvement in PAT (profit after tax) as a percentage of revenue—from -63% in FY23 to -28% in FY24—signals better financial discipline and operational efficiencies.\\\\nBusiness Model and Operations\\\\nZepto operates through Kiranakart Technologies Pvt Ltd, its Indian entity responsible for:\\\\n– Licensing the Zepto brand.\\\\n– Trading consumer goods.\\\\n– Providing logistics services.\\\\n– Running advertisements on the Zepto app.\\\\nKiranakart acts as a B2B (business-to-business) platform, supplying goods to various entities operating under the Zepto umbrella. This integrated structure enables Zepto to scale operations rapidly while maintaining centralized control over the supply chain.\\\\nFunding and Expansion\\\\nZepto has raised an astounding ₹11,475 crore ($1.35 billion) in back-to-back funding rounds over just five months, bolstering its financial position. As of FY24, the company reported a cash and bank balance of ₹692 crore, but the recent funding injections have significantly strengthened its balance sheet.\\\\nThis capital influx is essential to sustain Zepto’s monthly cash burn rate of ₹250–₹300 crore, which translates to roughly ₹10 crore per day. The funding supports:\\\\n– Expansion of operations.\\\\n– Setting up new dark stores to enhance delivery speed.\\\\n– Positioning the company for future growth amid rising competition.\\\\nIPO Plans and Domestic Base Flip\\\\nZepto is gearing up for an ambitious $500 million Initial Public Offering (IPO) in 2025. To align with its public market aspirations, the company is preparing to shift its base from Singapore to India. It has already appointed Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Axis Capital to lead the IPO process.\\\\nThis move reflects Zepto’s commitment to strengthening its domestic presence and tapping into the growing Indian stock market.\\\\nZepto operates in a fiercely competitive quick commerce market, vying against:\\\\n– Blinkit (market leader).\\\\n– Swiggy Instamart.\\\\n– Established players like Flipkart Minutes and Tata BigBasket.\\\\n– Potential entrants like Amazon.\\\\nWhile Blinkit holds a dominant position in terms of market share, Zepto’s higher revenue highlights its capability to outpace competitors in value terms. However, sustaining this momentum requires balancing rapid growth with cost management.\\\\nZepto’s focus remains on operational efficiency, market expansion, and transitioning toward profitability. The company’s leadership is confident about achieving PAT profitability soon, driven by improved revenue and disciplined cost control.\\\\nAdditionally, its plans to go public and increase its domestic footprint could unlock new growth opportunities while reducing reliance on external funding.\\\\nZepto’s FY24 performance showcases its potential to transform India’s quick commerce sector. With a revenue of ₹4,455 crore, reduced losses, and strong investor backing, the company is well-positioned for sustained growth.\\\\nAs it navigates challenges from competitors and prepares for a landmark IPO, Zepto’s aggressive expansion strategy and customer-centric model make it a frontrunner in shaping the future of quick commerce in India.\\\\n                \\\\n                \\')], _name=None, _meta={})]}', origin=ToolCall(tool_name='webSearch', arguments={'query': 'Zepto growth drivers and profitability focus'}, id=None), error=False)], _name=None, _meta={}),\n",
