What is Zepto‚Äôs Business Model?\\nThere‚Äôs both a simple and a complex way of introducing Zepto‚Äôs Business Model.\\nIn simple words - You order groceries from Zepto and they deliver it to your location. They make money out of this process.\\nLet‚Äôs say that you have some visitors home. You want some sweets and a packet of chips to serve your guests. So you would go to Zepto, choose all the items you want to order, pay for it and get it in under 10 minutes.\\nBut here‚Äôs everything Zepto has to do to get those product to your home in under 10 mins ‚è¨\\nRent a warehouse and assemble their dark store\\nHire delivery executives to deliver your order\\nHire folks to handle all the packing, arranging & all other operational tasks inside the warehouse\\nHire folks to handle support when things don‚Äôt go as planned\\nSpeak to local suppliers to get the groceries and other supplies to their dark store\\nBuild an app to display all the items for the customers\\nSpeak to UPI aggregators, banks & other financial institutions to setup seamless payment systems for you\\nBuild in-house systems to communicate your order to the operational staff\\nBuild in-house systems to help the delivery executive pickup orders and deliver them safely\\n& so much more‚Ä¶.\\nWhatever you see on your smartphone is only possible because of a ton of moving parts that seem to be seamlessly fixed with each other. This is the very simple answer to Zepto‚Äôs Business Model ü§üüèº\\nTo understand the complex version of Zepto‚Äôs business model, you can jump to the relevant section using the quick links below\\nTo breakdown this craziness behind the 10 min delivery, our team downloaded Zepto and made a quick order. We made sure that the order contained a mix of meat, fruits & milk (their highest margin items). Zepto delivered this order in less than 13 minutes!\\nWe also looked at a ton of user interviews and founder interviews on YouTube to understand the Zepto business model in depth.\\nEverything you see here is a result of mix of original research gathered from the internet and the users of Zepto. Here are the 5 key pieces that allow Zepto to deliver your order in 10 minutes or less!\\n1. Darkstores & Microwarehouses:\\nDarkstores are physical warehouses where all the items you see on the Zepto app are placed in. When you order anything, a Zepto delivery executive picks up all your items from one of these dark stores and brings it to you.\\nUnlike traditional retail stores, you cannot go to a dark store and buy your grocery items. Dark stores can only be accessed by Zepto‚Äôs team members and their vendors.\\nDark stores are the sole reason why Zepto is able to deliver some orders in under 10 minutes. By being in close proximity to a dense urban are, they are able to deliver your order quickly.\\nFor example, let‚Äôs consider Indiranagar in Bangalore.\\nBy placing a warehouse in this location, Zepto will be able to service all these neighbourhoods in under 10 minutes.\\nIf the order frequency and retention is good, the dark stores will max out almost instantly. Then they could either add more deliver partners to the same dark store or simplu open up one more dark store nearby!\\nWhat happens if that dark store also reaches a bottleneck?\\nIn that case, Zepto opens up another dark store to meet demands.\\nBut thanks to their experienced leadership team, all these expansion decisions are backed by data. They take into account geography, future growth potential, traffic, weather, driver availability & much more before they even think about opening a new dark store.\\n2. Super Quick Packaging\\nThe founding principles of Zepto has always been impeccable operations backed by custom built software. That‚Äôs how they scaled their first store and that‚Äôs the same principle they‚Äôre using for all their stores across India.\\nOnce you place an order, an operations executive inside their warehouse will get two things\\nA list of all the items in your orders\\nA map to navigate themselves inside the warehouse to pickup all the items in the least amount of time\\nThe second point is what truly allows Zepto to become a kingpin on operational efficiency üöÄ. As their CTO Kaivalya Arora says, ‚ÄòWe have designed the process to make sure the entire order is dispacted in 60 - 90 seconds‚Äô\\nThis means that the rest of the time is entirely spent on the last mile delivery, thereby easing some pressure on the delivery partner.\\nThis brings us onto our third point\\n3. Internal Structure of the warehouses\\nOperational efficiency is the name of the game when it comes to any operations heavy business. And Zepto achieves operational efficiency in a class of its own üßóüèº‚ôÄÔ∏è.\\nThe operations have streamlined the entire warehouse with a data led approach. They‚Äôve looked at the items which move the quickest and have placed it closer to the entrance. Groceries which are not frequenlty ordered are de-prioritised and placed at the back.\\nThe creative below will give you an idea of how a darkstore might be structured based on the order frequency of different items. Although this structure is just an example and is subject to change based on several other factors.\\nBut Multiply this structural formula with item size, refrigeration needs, fragility & you will get a repeatable model of how to design all your warehouses at scale üöÄ\\nFor example, fruits & vegetables are one of their most important and highest margin categories. Hence they have decided to place them in shelves closer to the entrance, where they‚Äôre very easy grab and place into delivery bags.\\nTo draw parallels, this is very similar to how the founders of McDonalds designed their Kitchen to complete customer orders in less than two minutes ü§Ø\\nIf you haven‚Äôt seen ‚ÄòThe Founder‚Äô on Netflix, this is an open call to see it ASAP. If you‚Äôre working in an operations heavy business or interested in building one, please remember that operational efficiency is crucial for your long term success.\\nBut, how do you design superfast systems even when human decisions are part of the system?\\nA human operator has to look at the order and decide the chronological order of items in the delivery bag. This takes time and there is also the risk of human errors. Items might be missed or fragile items might end up getting placed at the bottom of the bag (No one likes to have their eggs & tomatoes crushed under a watermelon ‚òπÔ∏è)\\nSo the team came up with a pretty simple solution - Give a tablet like device to each operations executive in the darkstore. It works like a Google map, guiding the executive to pickup the items placed in the warehouse.\\nOnce the operator is assigned an order, they are told where and how to pick each item in a chronological order.\\nTheir CTO Kaivalya says ‚ÄúWe wanted to remove human decisions as much as possible. So each of our executives have a handheld software device driving them through the most optimal pathway‚Äù\\nThis system works like a charm and has allowed them to exponentially open new dark stores across India üöÄ, while maintaining quality control.\\n4. Incredibly short distances to delivery:\\nBigBasket took anywhere between 3 hours to a day to deliver a bag of groceries, while Zepto does it in 10 minutes. A lot of this speed is heavily owed to a warehouse that is present in close proximity to an urban location. This is just simple physics bringing down the time of the last mile delivery.\\nSince the distances are closer, the delivery executives are also able to fulfill their orders quicker. Moreover with customers who order frequently, Zepto can assign the same set of delivery partners to fullfil their orders. Since they are well acquainted with the location of the customers, this brings the Time To Deliver even lower üëçüèº.\\n5. Driver‚Äôs Familiarity with their locality:\\nThe operations team at Swiggy use incredibly sophisticated Machine Learning models to bring down the total deliver time. Right from choosing which partner gets which order to how many order each partner picks up.\\nThis allows the delivery partner to\\nPickup multiple order and deliver them on the way\\nDeliver one order and pickup an order from a nearby hotel\\nTo even give you a rough estimation, Swiggy has to calculate four things before assigning a delivery partner to your order.\\nThis gets more complex when the delivery executive has to pickup one more order or has to deliver one more order on the way to your house.\\nIf you thought that was complex, think about assigning a delivery partner at random. Sometimes they might be familiar with your area. Sometimes they might not be familiar with your locality. Now combine this with traffic and other humane errors!\\nWith Zepto, some of these problems like Prep Time are naturally removed due to the nature of the business. Since the drivers are also operating in a familiar locality, the first mile & last mile times are brought down significantly.\\nHere‚Äôs how the Zepto would calculate time for a delivery partner who‚Äôs already at the darkstore\\nThe human factor is definitely one of the bigger advantages of Zepto. In a matter of weeks, the delivery partners become familiar with each road and each shortcut. Familiarity breeds speed and the delivery partners get quick with time.\\nIf you‚Äôre interested about how Swiggy does their driver routing, please do give this and this a read üëçüèº\\n2. How does Zepto make money üí∏?\\nWe‚Äôve seen how Zepto operates from a micro and a macro view. They store groceries in a darkstore and deliver them with the help of their delivery partners. But all this seems like a costly affair to run. They have to pay rent for each darkstore, salaries for darkstore operators & payments for delivery partners. These are fixed operating costs to Zepto.\\nAdd this on top of the tech, product & marketing costs, it‚Äôll give you a fair idea of the amount of money required to keep Zepto alive. So how does Zepto earn money selling groceries?\\nHere are the five ways they are currently earning money ü§ë, along with one potential way Zepto they can earn money in the future üöÄ\\n1. Margins on each individual product:\\nThe most common way grocery delivery startups earn money is on the margins of each individual product. This model is similar to the retailers who buy goods at a lower cost from distributors and sell it at a higher price ‚úÖ\\nFor example, let‚Äôs assume that Zepto sells a kg of onion for a price of 24 rupees. They earn margins on this by buying a large quantity from a distributor at a lower price.\\nWe went to the internet and checked for prices of onions from distributors. The prices range from anywhere between 10 rupees/ kg to 20 rupees/ kg.\\nIf they are able to tie up with a buyer at the lowest price, this is definitely a win win for both of them. Because Zepto gets onion at a lower price and the distributor also gets his order fulfilled almost frequently leading to repeatable revenue numbers.\\nFor starters we did some calculations as to how much revenue Zepto could earn from just one warehouse and from onion üß†\\nLet‚Äôs assume that Zepto orders 100 kg of onion for one of its warehouses in Bandra every day.\\nThe price of one kilogram of onion comes around to 10 rupees.\\nSo let‚Äôs assume that the total cost to Zepto along with transportation is 1200 rupees.\\nLet‚Äôs also assume an ideal state where they are able to sell the entire 100 kg over the same day.\\nWe know that zepto currently sells onion at a price of 24 rupees/ kg.\\nNow that‚Äôs 2400 rupees before taxes & other charges.\\nNot bad for 100 kgs of onion sold in just one darkstore.\\nAccording to their CTO, Kaivalya -‚ÄùPotatoes, Onion, Tomatoes are some of our highest selling items on Zepto. Fruits & vegetables also happen to be one of the highest margin items on our platform‚Äù\\nOnion is just one category here. One look into Zepto and you‚Äôll see hundreds of vegetables, fruits, and quick perishable items, all of which are high margin items on Zepto!\\n2. Handling Charges\\nHandling charge is the fee collected by Zepto to organise, pack and dispatch the items on your list. We clicked on the ‚Äòinformation‚Äô button to understand more about this handling charge and we were thrown the following message - ‚ÄúHandling charge is levied to ensure the products are handled, packed & dispatched safely‚Äù\\nWe tried to see if a handling charge is levied by all grocery delivery platforms in India\\nSwiggy Instamart - Yes, they had a handling charge\\nBigBasket NOW - They had something called a delivery token, but it seemed very similar to this handling charge\\nBlinkit - Surprisingly, they did not have a handling charge\\nWe figured that the handling charge was not a set standard across all grocery delivery platforms. So this is something that is levied by platforms in different ways.\\n3. Delivery Charges\\nThis is the second bigger piece of solving the profitability equation for most delivery grocery startups. Delivery charge is a big incredibly important for solving profitability because\\nNo matter the size of the order, Zepto has to pay the same delivery fee to their delivery partner\\nBut high delivery charges can also be a reason why users stop buying from Zepto\\nThe key here is to find the balance between waiving delivery charges and growing profitably üí™üèº. Zepto has solved this problem by choosing to charge customers for orders with a low value basket size. However if you break a certain threshold, you‚Äôll unlock the option to get a ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô\\nIncreasing the threshold to unlock free delivery does two things\\nIncreases the AOV of each order by encouraging customer to order more\\nImprove revenue by charging delivery fee on orders with low AOV\\nThe net benefit is aimed at increasing overall revenue from the ‚Äòdelivery fee‚Äô lever. But it might also reduce the overall order frequency for certain ICPs who are Power users. High delivery fees might discourage users who use Zepto to order everything at the last minute.\\nHence this a profit lever the ‚ÄòGrowth Team‚Äô must constantly tweak and experiment with data!\\nBut the fact is that people are tier 1 cities are increasingly favouring CONVENIENCE >>> MONEY. Our hypothesis is that most folks won‚Äôt mind paying a delivery fee of 25 - 50 get their order delivered.\\nLet‚Äôs assume that Sheila orders from Zepto 6 times a week\\n‚Üí Even if she gets 3 free deliveries a week, we still have 3 deliveries where Zepto earns a revenue\\n‚Üí If she‚Äôs paying 35/ delivery, that‚Äôs 105 rupees for a week.\\n‚Üí Extrapolate that across a month and Zepto has earned a revenue of 420 rupees.\\n‚Üí Assuming there are 100 customers like her in one dark store, Zepto has just earned 42,000 rupees just from deliveries.\\nYou should note that these these numbers are highly speculative and can vary a lot. But you get the gist. Done right, Zepto can find a balance between earning from delivery charges while also maintaining the user frequency ü´Ç\\nOne interesting fact to note that if your order is less than 50 rupees, Zepto levies a fee of ‚ÄòSmall Cart Fee‚Äô of Rupees 35. This will incentivise the user to add more to their cart quite naturally!\\n4. Product Customisations:\\nUser Research is something we push actively in the GrowthX experience. Before you hypothesize any solution, you should always seek to understand your users and their problems.\\nIn Zepto‚Äôs case, it‚Äôs safe to say that they‚Äôve identified their customers and their problems incredibly well. One good example is under their fruits and vegetables section\\nRight from peeled onion, to cut carrots & loose corn. They have identified ways to take existing vegetables, customize them and increase their prices üöÄ\\nFor example:\\n500 grams of carrot costs 45 rupees.\\nBringing it down to 100 grams this costs just 9 rupees.\\nBut 200 grams of peeled carrots costs 53 rupees on Zepto.\\nBringing this down to 100 grams costs a whopping 26 rupees\\nBy simply washing and cutting up the carrots, they have found ways to increase their margins on their products.\\nSimple economics shows a 300% increase in price ü§Ø just by customising the product a bit.\\nSure you‚Äôll have to buy expensive machinery or employ people to help with these customisation. But if Zepto is able to achieve good volumes, this cost will also go down as it‚Äôs fixed!\\nZepto definitely nailed ‚ÄòPeople don‚Äôt buy your product, they buy the solution that can be achieved with your product‚Äô ü§òüèº\\n5. Product Ads:\\nProduct Ads are a proven way to earn predictable revenue in most e-commerce and marketplace businesses. Zepto also pulls this off Product Ads in a flawless manner\\nAlmost everyone in the grocery space uses product ads as a monetary lever.\\nThe concept is simple: If you‚Äôre a retailer, you can give money to Zepto to feature your products at the top of certain searches & categories.\\nFor example, Bru features their ‚ÄòBru Instant Pure Coffee Jar‚Äô at the first position for the keyword ‚Äòcoffee.\\n6. Membership:\\nThis is a model Zepto hasn‚Äôt experimented yet, but proves to a very solid model for predictable revenue growth. Swiggy has already rolled out this membership model in the name of ‚ÄòSwiggy One‚Äô.\\nBy subscribing to their membership, you can get\\nFree deliveries on all orders\\nNo surge fees\\nBetter discounts\\nOther ecommerce startups also have similar models like\\nAmazon‚Äôs ‚ÄòAmazon Prime‚Äô,\\nFlipkart‚Äôs ‚ÄòFlipkart Plus‚Äô &\\nMeesho‚Äôs upcoming membership model.\\nThe membership will model will allow Zepto to predict how their revenue will grow with certainty. It can also be beneficial since it increase customer retention and serves as a good moat!\\nWe will have to wait and see if Zepto also rolls out this feature in the future!\\nüí°\\nBy the way, the depth you see here is just a feeler of the depth we teach at GrowthX üí´\\nGrowthX is an invite-only club of over 3000 members who are product, marketing, and business leaders, and founders from top internet-first companies like Google, Canva, CRED, Stripe, Netflix, and more üíé\\nWe teach our members how to scale revenues via frameworks that can be applied starting next Monday morning.

This growth is possible because they had a structured approach to growth in the first place. Be it creating marketing copies or opening up new darkstores, everything has a structure in place.\\nIn this section we will create a structured Growth strategy for Zepto to reach a business goal in a specific period of time.\\n1. Who is Zepto‚Äôs Ideal customer?\\nBefore we nail down on Zepto‚Äôs ICP, let‚Äôs look at a couple of practical use cases of Zepto\\nYou have a few visitors at home and you need to serve them snacks. Maybe you order some fruits and snack items on Zepto for your visitors\\nYou are prepping for breakfast when you realise the batter you have has expired. So you go to Zepto and order for some fresh ID dosa batter\\nYou are preparing lunch when you realise that you don‚Äôt have any onions left for dinner. Maybe you order some onions along with a fresh set of groceries for the next three days\\nYou feel the need to snack and want some biscuits and chips. So you go to Zepto to order some snacks along with essential groceries for the week\\nYou step into the washroom to brush your teeth, only to realise you are out of paste. You quickly open Zepto and get some paste delivered in the next 10 minutes\\nThese are just a tiny subset of the use cases of Zepto. Also most of these examples were just around groceries. Zepto also has a ton of other sub categories like\\nCleaning Essentials\\nMakeup items\\nBaby care\\nBath & Body care\\nElectricals & Accessories\\n& much more\\nA simple probability check will show you that the use cases are in the thousands (and growing as Zepto plans to add new categories ü§òüèº). Before you build any growth strategy, you need to find a way to bucket these millions of users & use cases into something consumable.\\nThis look into Zepto‚Äôs ideal customer is nothing perfect. But it will give you a solid foundation into Zepto‚Äôs primary users.\\nWe have borrowed these insights from the assignment submitted by one of our members - Aadeesh Deshpande (GX12). He is currently working as Associate Director - Business Development and Key Accounts at MX Player. You can reach him through his LinkedIn here.\\nCharacteristics\\nPotential ICP 1\\nPotential ICP 2\\nPotential ICP 3\\nPotential ICP 4\\nName\\nYoung Guns\\nMidlife\\nPushing 40s\\nVery Young\\nAge\\n21 - 26\\n26 - 35\\n35 - 44\\n18 - 21\\nIncome\\n8 lakhs/ annum+\\n20 lakhs/ annum+\\n30 lakhs/ annum+\\nNone\\nRelationship Status\\n‚Üí Unmarried\\n‚Üí Sometimes in a relationship\\n‚Üí Mostly Married\\n‚Üí Sometimes Unmarried\\n‚Üí If Married, mostly has children\\n‚Üí Married\\n‚Üí Mostly has children\\n‚Üí Unmarried\\nEmployment Status/ Work Experience\\n‚Üí Freshly Employed\\n‚Üí Has a solid work experience\\n‚Üí Already in a second job or been promoted in the first\\n‚Üí Mature work experience\\n‚Üí Mostly in Leadership roles\\n‚Üí Mostly Unemployed\\n‚Üí Sometimes working part time or in an Internship\\nMore trust, improved experience with Online platforms.\\nThe overall MACRO needs to change to enable this population\\nMore Disposable Income.\\nRight now, most folks in this segment are not earning or earning very low\\nThis table gives you a small peek into the ICPs of Zepto and their buying habits. This table is nowhere close to perfect. We‚Äôre sure that the growth team inside Zepto will have more data points on this.\\nBut this table gives you a basic overview into\\nWho are buying from Zepto?\\nWhy are they buying from Zepto?\\nWhat are they buying from Zepto?\\nAnd their major blockers to spend more on Zepto\\nWith these characteristics in mind, let‚Äôs take a peek into the market sizing of Zepto üëáüèº\\n2. Understanding the market (TAM, SAM, SOM)\\nIn an interview with Master‚Äôs Union, their CTO Kaivalya Arora says ‚Äúwe went from 5 to 77+ dark stores from Sep to Dec, 2022‚Äù\\nThis massive growth is backed by some of the top investors in the market like Nexus, Glade Brook & YCombinator. This is even after there are tons of grocery startups in the market like Instamart, Blinkit and let‚Äôs not forget Tata‚Äôs BigBasket!\\nThis is possible because of the nature & scale of the grocery business in India üáÆüá≥\\nTheir CEO points the scale of the grocery & essential industry in a beautiful way - ‚ÄúDmart has built a $40 Billion dollar business in a matter of 20 years. If we can even capture a portion of that volume, we can build a profitable business effectively‚Äù\\nSo the question is\\n‚ùì\\nHow big is the grocery market and how much market share is available for Zepto?\\nIndia is a massive country with a total population of 1.5 billion people ü§Ø\\nBut Zepto cannot cater to this entire base as most of them are located in Tier 2+ cities & rural areas. Maybe Zepto will tap everyone in India (in the future) or maybe we‚Äôll have a Tier 2+ focused startup like Meesho focusing on just that market!\\nBut for the foreseeable future, Zepto will only be focusing on the folks living in Tier1+ cities with Annual salaries greater than 10 lakh/ annum\\nKartik Narang (GX10), a fellow GrowthX member and Capabilities & Insights Analyst McKinsey laid out this TAM calculation in an incredible manner in one of his acquisition assignmentsüöÄ\\nCondition\\nCalculation\\nTotal Population in Tier 1 Cities in India\\n70 Million\\nPercentage of People between 20 & 40 years of age\\n40%\\nTotal Population in Tier 1 cities between the age of 20 - 40\\n28 Million\\nPercentage of Annual Income greater than 10 lakhs\\n40%\\nTotal Population in Tier 1 cities between the age 20 - 40 with Annual Income greater than 10 lakhs\\n11.2 Million\\nAverage number of people per household\\n4\\nTotal Number of houses that can be reached\\n11.2/ 4 ‚áí 3 Million households\\n„Ö§\\n„Ö§\\nThe total TAM in terms of the number of households can be assumed anywhere between 3 to 7 million based on the variations in the following categories\\nSwati Poddar (GX9), another fellow GrowthX member and PM at Walmart has smartly converted this into revenue numbers by multiplying the TAM with the average spend on groceries for each household. This was also an acquisition assignment as part of the GrowthX learning experience.\\nüí°\\nBy the way, the depth you see here is just a feeler of the depth we teach at GrowthX üí´\\nGrowthX is an invite-only club of over 3000 members who are product, marketing, and business leaders, and founders from top internet-first companies like Google, Canva, CRED, Stripe, Netflix, and more üíé\\nWe teach our members how to scale revenues via frameworks that can be applied starting next Monday morning. The GrowthX Membership is built on 3 core pillars:\\n1. Learning experience: Where you learn the science of revenue-led growth with frameworks actionable the next Monday morning.\\n2. Curated community: Where you access a safe space for you to soundboard anything that is stressing you at work.\\n3. Career outcomes: Over 35% of members are founders & are able to hire growth teams to scale revenue for their companies while operators are able to get into breakout leadership roles.\\nExplore GrowthX Membership üèÜ\\nBy Swati‚Äôs calculation with a TAM of 7 Million and an average household grocery spend of 10,000 rupees/ month, the revenue TAM comes down to 704 crores/ month\\nWe can say that Swati‚Äôs TAM is way different from Kartik‚Äôs TAM Calculations. But this doesn‚Äôt mean that one of their calculations are wrong.\\nTAM calculation is all about making informed assumptions with the data we have in mind\\nIn Swati‚Äôs case, she considered the average number of people/ household as 2.5. Hence the major difference in the overall TAM number. In essence, TAM is just to give you an idea about the potential size of the market. It is always changing and is never a number set in stone üöÄ\\nHere‚Äôs how the TAM Range will look based on same average household grocery spend of 10,000 rupees/ month ‚è¨\\nTAM (In Terms of number of households)\\n3 Million\\n4 Million\\n5 Million\\n6 Million\\n7 Million\\nAvg Household Spend On Groceries\\n10,000\\n10,000\\n10,000\\n10,000\\n10,000\\nTAM (In Terms of Total Achievable Revenue)\\n300 Crores/ month\\n400 Crores/ month\\n500 Crores/ month\\n600 Crores/ month\\n700 Crores/ month\\nWhen you start gathering more data points, you can also do TAM Calculations based on different ICPs and customer segments. This can help you decide everything from Growth strategies to overall product positioning and key business decisions ü§ôüèº\\n3. Zepto‚Äôs Growth Strategy\\nBased on this market & ICP research, we can create a Growth Strategy for Zepto. The growth strategy contains five main levers which are\\nAcquisition\\nOnboarding\\nEngagement & Retention\\nMonetisation\\nBuilding a Growth Team\\nBut all of these levers don‚Äôt mean anything when you don‚Äôt understand the core goal.\\nWe have built this growth strategy using the same foundations we teach our members as part of the GrowthX Learning Experience. If you also want to create structured and outcome driven growth model like this for your startup, check out our experience here üí™üèº\\nWhat is Zepto‚Äôs goal for the next 2 - 5 years?\\nIf you ask us, we definitely have no clue. So that‚Äôs why we are going to hypothesize their goals based on two things\\nTheir current growth numbers\\nFounder Interviews on YouTube\\nLooking at both, one things becomes very clear. One of their current goals is to grow as quickly as possible. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that they don‚Äôt have profitability in mind. They are looking to grow their revenue numbers with the goal of achieving optimal profitability in the next two to five years.\\nThey also understand that anyone can copy their business model and quickly overtake them. So their core goal is to also open new dark stores across various markets, establish their presence, gain users & use that as their MOAT!\\nIn simple words, you could hypothesise their goal as\\n‚Üí Expand to all Tier 1 cities in India and achieve a revenue of XXXX in YYYY number of years\\nSince we don‚Äôt have any insider information about Zepto, we‚Äôre just going to assume the revenue number as $500 Million ARR and year as 3. We assume this because Their CEO mentions in one the interviews that they had easily crossed $100 Million ARR a while back.\\nSince acquiring new users is going to play a key role, we are going to prioritise Acquisition as our first lever\\nSince retaining these users and getting them back is also key to revenue growth & profitabilty, we‚Äôre going to prioritise Engagement & Retention as our second lever\\nSince it‚Äôs a mobile app, we need to make sure any user who‚Äôs downloading it, actually ends up using Zepto. We‚Äôre focusing on our Onboarding lever as the third priority\\nFinally, we cannot let profitability be an afterthought. It also needs a bit of focus fro the get go. So we‚Äôre going with our Monetisation lever as the fourth priority\\nOnce we break down all these levers, we‚Äôll get a very clear idea on how to build our Growth team. Some common questions like\\nWho To Hire?\\nWhen To Hire?\\nBudgets For Hiring?\\nWhich are must have roles and good to have roles?\\nNOTE: Your growth strategy is not set in stone. Based on the business goals, the market conditions and tons of other factors, your growth strategy will always be evolving. The best growth minds are always aware of this and are willing to tweak their strategies based on the macro and micro changes üöÄ.\\n4. Acquisition\\nWe have defined 4 different ICPs in the ideal customer section. Each ICP has a different set of needs and different marketing strategies that work for them.\\nA really good growth team understand this and will tweak their marketing strategies based on the ICP they‚Äôre trying to reach.\\nFor this case, we‚Äôre just going to look at ICP 1 - The ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô. These are folks in the age range of 20 - 25 and purchase everything from online grocery platforms like Instamart, Zepto & BigBasket.\\nWe will only create a Growth Model for this ICP. Since they have a lot of unplanned purchases, their usage frequency is also very high. Also because they are young and have a lot of disposable income, their ability & willingness to spend is also high.\\nThe most common acquisition channels to reach our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô are\\nYou can use the quick links below to jump to any specific section in our Acquisition Lever\\nNow let‚Äôs break down all the acquisition levers for Zepto‚Äôs growth model\\nOrganic\\nZepto‚Äôs organic strategy for the ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô has three splits. This is based on how they discover new products and where they usually spend their time on.\\nSearch Engine Optimisation (SEO):\\nSEO is the art of ranking your business when your ideal customer searches for it. Since SEO is a pull channel, you need to identify the different ways in which your customers might search for your product\\nHere are some common themes we were able to identify with Search Engine Optimisation.\\nHere‚Äôs the breakdown with some common examples\\nMost of the keywords here were occupied by market leaders like Amazon & BigBasket. Currently Zepto doesn‚Äôt seem to have an SEO strategy in place. It‚Äôs website is also pretty basic, displaying just information information only about their organisation.\\nFor starters, their main competitor BigBasket brings around 6.4 million website visitors from smartphone traffic alone. It‚Äôs the ideal time for Zepto to think about organic SEO strategies if they‚Äôre certain about building this for the long term üöÄ\\nTo start with SEO, they need to invest in a website strategy that ties in with their app usage. Most of their users will use Zepto on their app. But the website is primarily to build pages and capture the SEO traffic.\\nEventually Zepto will also have to build a full scale website like BigBasket if they want to tap into the fullscale SEO potential.\\nApp Store Optimisation(ASO):\\nSince Zepto is a mobile app first business, App Store & Play Store discovery is a high priority. App Store Optimisation is the art of ranking your app for relevant searches and in the relevant categories.\\nASO can also be broken down into the three types of searches, which we have broken down in the Whimsical below\\nApart from search, you also need to ensure your app is free from technical glitches and bugs. Pair this with a healthy number of positive reviews, your app will also be displayed in top positions under\\nRelated Applications\\nTop Free Apps\\nTrending Apps\\netc..\\nYour best bet is to make sure your app\\nIs free from technical glitches\\nHas an incredible user experience\\nTons of Positive Reviews (Possibly 4+ stars)\\nSocial Media:\\nSocial Media is yet another untapped opportunity for Zepto. One of the reasons we suggest social media is because\\nSwiggy, Zomato and a lot of D2C, FMCg brands have been doubling down on Organic social for the same reasons. While it requires constant effort and a lot of experimentation to stay relevant on social, the efforts gradually pay off.\\nSince the ‚ÄòYoung Gun‚Äô ICPs are extremely young and spend a lot of time on social media applications, it makes perfect sense ü§òüèº\\nThe Social Media strategy would be a mix of long form content (For YouTube etc) and Short form content (for YouTube Shorts & Reels)\\nLong Form Content ‚Üí\\nThe general theme of long form content is to provide value first. We can start with things ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô might already be searching for. Since some of them might be living alone, some ideas could be\\nCooking Tips\\nHome Cleaning Tips\\nHealthy Eating Tips\\netc‚Ä¶.\\nShort Form Content ‚Üí\\nShort form content should focus on funny anecdotes and things these folks might find relatable.\\nFunny Reels\\nRelatable Memes\\nQuick Informational Videos\\netc‚Ä¶.\\nHowever considering the entire macro, social media needs to be inclusive of all ICPs. It should not just be relatable to our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô. The overall brand persona and positioning should also be in mind when creating these strategies.\\nZepto has had a very heavy reliance on PAID Ads to grow. It is fair given how their business is location dependant and Paid is the best channel for location based targeting.\\nSince PAID Ads can be customised and deployed quite quickly, it‚Äôs Time To Value from them is much quicker. Paid Ads can be divided into three sub categories\\nThese are advertisements that will be displayed on search engines like Google, Bing and other platforms. The targeting here is based on individual keywords, rather than just interests or demographic data üöÄ\\nProduct Ads:\\nProduct based ads which focus on specific products can be extremely useful for Zepto. They have two strategies for product base search ads\\nProducts that are low AOV, but high margins (fruits, vegetables etc..)\\nProducts that are high AOV, but low margin (Oil, Atta etc..)\\nProducts that have a high purchase frequency, but low AOV & ROI (Snacks, Quick Munchies)\\nWhich products they want to go after is entirely dependant on a strategy backed by data üíΩ\\nBrand Ads:\\nBrand Ads can be used for keywords where someone is searching for your product, but you don‚Äôt have the sub pages ready for it.\\nOr you can also use it to capitalise on the Inbound search terms until SEO kicks in.\\nBrand Ads can also be used to kick out competitors for products which Zepto thinks will give them good retention.\\nCompetitor Ads:\\nThese ads can be run over competitor pages or also be run over products which Zepto‚Äôs competitor‚Äôs are ranking for. Yet again, this can be used to capture a new market, a new product if you think they might help with your retention rates.\\nSocial Ads:\\nSocial ads come in really handy when you‚Äôre trying to target based on location, interests or both.\\nIf Zepto is trying to scale up each individual dark store chronologically, this is a great way to reach customers. You can target based on age, interests, gender & more based on the data platforms given by advertising platforms ü§òüèº\\nWe need to be mindful of two things when running social ads\\nWhat‚Äôs the key value proposition for this ICP?\\nHow do we convert that into our messaging?\\nWhich social platforms are they most active in?\\nAs we‚Äôre just focusing on the ‚ÄòYoung Gun‚Äô ICP, we also need to make sure the messaging is on point for them. Their messaging can be derived from their Key Value Propositions such as\\n10 Min Delivery\\nFresh Groceries At Your Doorstep\\nSave Time\\nHere‚Äôs how a static ad might look for them on a social media platform\\nHere‚Äôs an example of a dynamic ad for Zepto.\\nIt‚Äôs both quirky and conveys the Key Value Proposition under 15 seconds. Perfect for social media platforms\\nWhile running social ads, we also need to mindful of the platforms each ICP is active on. Our ICP is active on Instagram, Snapchat & Facebook which are all good platforms to start with üé¢\\nApp Store Ads:\\nSince they‚Äôre an app first platform, it makes a lot of sense to prioritise App Store Ads when you‚Äôre starting with the paid channel. The grocery market is a bit mature thanks to old players like BgBasket, Blinkit and other incumbents\\nSo it‚Äôs Zepto‚Äôs best bet to capitalise on the existing search volume on these platforms üöÄ\\nApp Store Ads can also be of two types as shown below\\nThese ad formats are a different beast in themselves. For the sake of keeping this short we are skipping the technicalities in this section for now.\\nThere‚Äôs an universal truth we need to understand before we get into Product Integrations. No app, product or business exists out there in Unison. While your customer is using your product, they are also simultaneously using multiple other products at the same time.\\nProduct Integration is the concept of seeking a natural fit with the products used by your users and integrating with them.\\nBut some ground rules before we seek Product Integrations\\nThe Product should not be a direct competitor to Zepto\\nThe Product Integration pitch should feel natural and personalised\\nThe product should also have good trust (as trust can be destroyed by partnering with a wrong brand)\\nThe product should preferably have the same or higher usage frequency than Zepto\\nFrom user interviews conducted by GrowthX members, we have discovered that Zepto users also use some products like UrbanClap, Netflix, Hotstar, EatFit etc‚Ä¶\\nHere are some interesting product integrations we can work out with the following products\\nUrban Company\\nHotstar\\nEatFit\\nThese are just some examples from the top of our head. Once you do more intense customer research, you will be able to find better products that have a better fit with your offerings.\\nPartnerships are lesser known ways to get your brand in front of tons of new customers. Zepto can approach partnerships in two different ways\\nInfluencer Partnerships\\nProduct Placements\\nEach has their merit and difference in their payback periods!\\nInfluencer Led Partnerships\\nThis essentially focuses on partnering with influencers whom your audience are also hooked into. Most of these partnerships are based on behavioural insights which can be derived from customer calls, surveys etc.\\nSince we‚Äôre trying to reach the ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô, we will start with the platforms they‚Äôre most active on - IG & YouTube. Step 2 is understanding the themes or which channels/ pages they follow.\\nWe know that this persona is focused on improving their career. So a good place to start is with channels that focus on ‚ÄòCareer specific advice‚Äô. Some of them could also be interested in cooking channels üï∫üèº.\\nThe main idea is to identify a theme and then double on those specific channels with a solid pitch.\\nProduct Placements\\nWeb series & movies are a great way to place your products in a subtle manner. The actor sipping on a cold coffee he ordered from Zepto. Or maybe the family member ordering something on Zepto.\\nThese are all subtle pitches to place your products in mainstream movies as well as smaller films & web series.\\nUnacademy pulled this off incredibly well with their product placements in tv series like Kota Factory, Operation MBBS etc. Product Placements should feel like natural and in sync with the plot. The core idea is to solidify Zepto as a product everyone uses casually in their life.\\nOffline ads probably have one of the best product-channel fits for Zepto because of their hyperlocal nature. When done right, this channel can solve for discovery for a very specific set of ICPs in one location. The best ICP to start with is our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô\\nHere are a couple of offline channel ideas to target ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô in their daily life\\nThey mostly take an Ola or Uber to reach their workplace\\nWe can place ads in autos & cabs behind the driver‚Äôs seat\\nThey might take a bus or the use the metro train\\nWe can also place banners in specially designated boards at these stops\\nThey will use the lift atleast twice a day in their office space\\nWe can place an ad inside the lift walls\\nThey will walk past the lobby in their office space (preferably an IT park)\\nWe can place custom booths that encourage people to download and try Zepto\\nOffline channels come in a variety of ways and help us target folks in a very specific locality!\\nFor most consumer led applications, referrals can be an incredible acquisition tool. Since our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô are highly social and tech savvy, referral can have a good product market fit for them.\\nAll good referral programs will nail 4 things in depth\\nThe reward for both the referrer and the referee\\nWhy will someone refer?\\nWhen will someone refer?\\nHow easy it is to refer?\\nEach section can use a separate page in reality. But for this guide, we‚Äôre going to focus on Zepto and our target ICP - ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô.\\nWhy will someone refer Zepto?\\nAt the heart of every successful referral program lies an incredible customer experience. The best reason someone will refer Zepto is when they have a great experience with it. A great experience is delivered when\\nThey get their order in under 15 minutes\\nThe items are fresh and undamaged\\nThe packaging is good\\nThey get exactly what they ordered for (not something different - happens frequently in grocery delivery apps)\\nTheir AOV of each order is high (Depth)\\nThey keep ordering multiple times a week (frequency)\\nThe idea here is to identify when someone has a good experience and then take them to the referral loop\\nWhen will someone refer Zepto?\\nThe discovery of the referral loop should always be placed in the ‚ÄòHappy Flow‚Äô of the customer.\\nSome examples of happy flows are\\nAfter a customer receives their order in under 15 minutes\\nAfter a customer has submitted a review\\nThe goal is to identify screens where the user is in a ‚ÄòHappy Flow‚Äô yet it still won‚Äôt hinder the primary goal (complete an order)\\nWhat is the reward?\\nA good reward does two things\\nEnables the customer to keep referring\\nEnables the new customers to & old customers to keep using the app\\nIn that frame of mind, rewards should be app specific and increase the usage of the app. Monetary rewards are good, but they prevent the users from investing the reward back into the app.\\nApp specific coins, coupons and dicsounts are always good currencies for a referral system. One such reward is Zepto‚Äôs ‚ÄòZepto cash‚Äô. It provides both the referrer and the referee with credits they can only use in Zepto.\\nHow easy is it to refer?\\nEase of a referral system depends on two things\\nDiscovery of the referral system\\nAbility to Track your referrals\\nDiscovery can be solved by showing the referral link in all the ‚ÄòHappy Flows‚Äô and also on the sidebar.\\nAbility to track referrals is important because it allows the referrer to understand where his referees are\\nHave they clicked on the link\\nHave the downloaded the app\\nHave they made their first transaction\\nBut building a referral program like this is resource intensive and takes up a lot of development effort (even with the use of tools!)\\nA good idea is to run a test to a small population before deploying it to tons of users. Some things that can be tested are\\nRewards for referee\\nRewards for referrer\\nPlacement of the referral link\\nTracking of the referral link\\nDifferent ways to share the referral link\\nHere are some metrics Zepto can track to ensure the success of it‚Äôs referral program\\nNumber of active users sending invites\\nNumber of invites per referrer\\nConversion rate to link clicks\\nConversion rate to app downloads\\nConversion rate to first purchase\\nConversion rate to first review\\nSo that‚Äôs all about the acquisiton strategies for Zepto ü§òüèº. Now let‚Äôs take a look into the next most important lever for Zepto‚Äôs success - E&R.\\nEngagement & Retention are the holy grail of building a successful product in any market. We could even go further and say, Engagement & Retention are the pillars of any successful business.\\nGood engagement leads to better retention.\\nBetter retention leads to revenue and word of mouth.\\nGood revenue means you can invest in the best talent, improve the product even more and rule the market\\nWord of mouth means that you can now acquire customers at costs that keep getting lower\\nAll these combine into a vicious cycle which make any product/ business successful.\\nWhere does retention come here?\\nSome of the best product teams think about retention right from the Onboarding. It‚Äôs all about helping the user become powerful with the product. Retention is never an afterthought in any successful product. When done right, retention can drive product & even business decisions.\\nHow does Engagement & Retention apply to our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\nBefore we even dive into the engagement framework for our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô, we need to understand some basic terms üëáüèº\\nFrequency of usage - Number of times someones orders from Zepto\\nDepth - No of items ordered in each category (Tomato, Onion, Potato under the vegetables section)\\nBreadth - No of categories ordered (1 Vegetable, 2 fruits, 1 Bread, 1 oil etc..)\\nThese are the 3 pillars of good engagement.\\nBased on these pillars we can define users into 3 buckets üëáüèº\\nCasual - People who order from Zepto once a week - once every two weeks\\nCore - People who order from Zepto two to three times a week\\nPower - People who order from Zepto 4+ times a week\\nWe are yet again going to pull excerpts from Aadeesh Deshpande‚Äôs (GX12) assignment on Zepto to deep dive into our framework.\\nThere are three types of buying habits for Zepto‚Äôs users üëáüèº\\nStock Up - Plan & buy groceries for the entire week\\nTop Up - Buying items that generally have a low shelf life (Vegetables, fruits, bread, milk etc.)\\nUnplanned Purchases - Items that might have run out without knowledge or items that have a sudden need (Oil, masala powders, Alcohol, Snacks etc..)\\nHere are some facts we know about our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô from the table we‚Äôve added above\\nCharacteristics\\nPotential ICP 1\\nName\\nYoung Guns\\nAge\\n21 - 26\\nIncome\\n8 lakhs/ annum+\\nRelationship Status\\n‚Üí Unmarried\\n‚Üí Sometimes in a relationship\\nEmployment Status/ Work Experience\\n‚Üí Freshly Employed\\nCity\\nTier 1\\nTech Savvy\\nYES\\nFrequently Used Social Media Apps\\nLinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram\\nEntertainment Services Used\\nDisney+ Hostar, Zee5, Amazon Prime\\nEcommerce services used\\nBookMyShow, Amazon, Myntra, Nykaa, Swiggy, Zomato, Zepto, Urban Company\\nIncome Spent On\\n1.

Travel\\nPurchase Behaviour for Groceries\\nPrefers to order weekly/ daily groceries online\\nCost or Convenience\\nConvenience\\nAnalysis Of Grocery Purchase Behaviour\\nStock up - 5%\\nTop Up - 30%\\nUnplanned Impulse Purchases - 65%\\nWhy Choose Zepto over other online Grocery Delivery Applications?\\n1. Quick Delivery\\n2. 24*7 Delivery\\n3. Can Discover products which they might not have planned ahead for\\n4. Discounts\\n5. Home Delivery\\nTypical Products Categories Ordered from Zepto\\n1. Groceries\\n2. Ready To Eat Items\\n3. Fruits, Vegetables, Milk, Bread & quick perishable items\\n4. Hygiene & Grooming\\n5. Sometimes Electronics & Home Cleaning\\n6. Snacks\\nOrder Frequency on Zepto\\n3 - 4 times a week\\nTime of Ordering from Zepto\\n1. Early Morning\\n2. Late Night\\nCustomer AOV\\nVery High\\nAbility To Spend\\nVery High\\nShift Needed to Spend on Zepto\\nNo Shift Needed\\nWe know that they rarely stock up on their daily needs. Most of their purchases are last minute and unplanned. We also know that this segment has a ton of disposable income and has a very low barrier of entry to Zepto.\\nWe also know that the majority of this segment live in a Tier 1 city which is where Zepto primarily operates. In his research, Aadeesh has quoted a research paper from Redseer which indicates that 70% of all grocery purchases are a mix of unplanned & top-up puchases.\\nSo what‚Äôs the engagement campaign for ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\nTitle\\nContent\\nUnderstanding\\nWe know that a ton of Young Guns order from Zepto 2 - 3 times a week. But this is only fruits, vegetables & some quick perishables.\\nType of user\\nAt the moment they are core users\\nGoal of the campaign\\nGet them to order from other categories like Snacks, Juices, Cleaning Essentials, Electricals etc‚Ä¶\\nWe want to eventually increase the breadth of the user and convert them into a power users\\nExperiments To Run\\n1. Quick Suggestions on the Checkout Screen\\n2. Placing other categories at the top of the Home Screen\\n3. Special Discounts for Items ordered from a New Category\\n4. Suggesting Item Combos based on the items you‚Äôve added in the Cart\\nAadeesh Deshpande had an incredible example to convert ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô from Core to Power users.\\nHere‚Äôs an example of how this will play out\\nItem\\nContent\\nScenario 1\\nA user adds onions & tomatoes\\nSample Pitch\\nSambhar on your mind?\\nItems Suggested\\n1. Sambhar Powder\\n2. Masala varieties\\n3. Ready to eat sides\\n4. Packet of chips\\nHere‚Äôs another example to increase breadth\\nItem\\nContent\\nScenario 2\\nA user adds paneer, onions & tomatoes on their cart\\nSample Pitch\\nPaneer butter masala on your mind?\\nItems Suggested\\n1. Garam Masala\\n2. Curd\\n3. Ready to eat Chapatti\\n4. Cashew nuts\\n5. Desserts (if it‚Äôs dinner)\\nThis could be paired up with other experiments on the homepage as well. But all this experimentation needs to be tracked to understand if it‚Äôs a success or not.\\nItem\\nContent\\nMetrics To Track\\n1. No of new categories ordered\\n2. Cart Size\\n3. No of core users selecting new categories from homepage\\n4. No of core users selecting new categories from ‚ÄòCategories‚Äô page\\n5.

Garam Masala\\n2. Curd\\n3. Ready to eat Chapatti\\n4. Cashew nuts\\n5. Desserts (if it‚Äôs dinner)\\nWhat does Retention look like for ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\nFor Zepto, the best retention happens with both depth (more items in one category) and breadth (ordering from multiple categories). Once they start ordering different items, Zepto becomes the go to place for our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô.\\nIncreasing Depth and Breadth makes Zepto their Go-To product which naturally increases their frequency of usage.\\nWhich channels drive the best retention for ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\nTimely Push Notifications:\\nPush Notifications that are backed up data is a great option. Let‚Äôs say one person orders a packet of milk every two days at exactly 9 PM. If they haven‚Äôt ordered milk for the last two days, a push notification asking them to order milk can go out ‚úåüèº\\nWhatsApp Notifications:\\nWhatsApp notifications can also be triggered as reminders for them.\\nLet‚Äôs assume that their favourite milkshake brand was out of stock in their last order. We can run a WhatsApp notification to tell them it‚Äôs back in stock\\nLet‚Äôs assume the milk example. We can push a WhatsApp notification to remind them\\nSlack or Teams Notifications\\nThis is a bit contradictory. But we know that ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô are heavily career focused. So there‚Äôs a very high chance that they may be using an internal communication tool like Slack or Microsoft Teams.\\nA quick growth test can be to connect their Slack IDs and send them reminders through them. Although be wary as this is just an hypothesis and hasn‚Äôt been proven by any grocery delivery startup yet!\\nWhich Products/ Categories drive the best retention?\\nQuick Perishable Items like Milk, Eggs, Bread, Fruits & Vegetables (High freq & high margin)\\nFlour, Oil, Rice items\\nBathroom & home cleaning equipments\\nBath, Body & Hygiene products\\nIndulgence items like Biscuits, Chips, Cold drinks, Ice cream etc..\\nFinally, why would ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô churn?\\nChurn can be divided into two types at the very basic level - Voluntary & Involuntary. Once you understand the reasons someone might churn, your team can work on preventing them. An acute understanding of the reasons can also help you fix issues in your marketing & brand perception\\nVoluntary Reasons For Churn\\nDelivery Time is too long\\nWrong Items were delivered\\nItems were delivered to the wrong address\\nProducts were damaged during delivery\\nExpired products were delivered\\nHigh delivery fee\\nProducts were out of stock\\nInvoluntary Reasons For Churn\\nShifted to a new location where Zepto is not available\\nOut of town for sometime\\nIssue with certain payment portals\\nAs you start mapping out all the potential reasons someone might churn, you can trace it back to early signs of churn. For example, if delivery time for a certain user has increased and you see a drop in their frequency, there might be some level of causation at play.\\nNegative actions to keep an eye on\\nDrop in App Open Rate\\nA lot of customer support tickets\\nDrop in the frequency of orders\\nDrop in basket value\\nDrop in weekly/ monthly AOV\\nIncrease in Cart Abandonment\\nA key concept you should keep in mind. There is a very good difference between causation and correlation.\\nIf order frequency is going down while delivery time increases, there is a high chance of relation between the two. But there is also a good chance that there‚Äôs no relation between the two.\\nMaybe they had a roommate who just moved out. Hence their order frequency is low\\nMaybe they started buying their fruits and vegetables from a street vendor because that was easy\\nAs a growth person, before you jump into any conclusions, you need to do the due diligence to understand the reason. You can do this by\\nSending a survey,\\nLooking at their support tickets\\nLooking at the change in items orders before & after change of freq\\nScheduling a 1:1 calls with your users\\n& more..\\nAs a growth person, your goal should be to seek the truth before you confirm your hypotheses.\\nWhat are some retention campaigns we can run for our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\nThis is an example we‚Äôve pulled out from Aadeesh Deshpande‚Äôs assignment on Zepto. We‚Äôre just tweaking a bunch of the ideas for better presentation.\\nConcept\\nCampaign Details\\nTarget Segment\\nCore & Power Users\\nTarget ICP\\nYoung Guns\\nPurchase Behaviour For Core Users\\n‚Üí Top Ups and last minute unplanned purchases\\n‚Üí Mostly fruits, vegetables, groceries & household items\\n‚Üí 5+ products in cart\\n‚Üí 3 times a week minimum\\nPurchase Behaviour For Power Users\\n‚Üí All Categories\\n‚Üí 2 to 10 products in cart\\n‚Üí 5+ times a week minimum\\nGoal\\nResurrect Core & Power Users\\nCampaign Targeting\\nFrequency of orders has reduced.\\nReason: Increase in Delivery Time\\nProposed Solution\\nApologise for the delayed delivery time and compensate with Zepto coins!\\nPitch/ Content\\nPush Notification on app/ WhatsApp Notification\\nWe understand that your time is money.\\n3 out of your last 5 deliveries were delayed by more than 15 minutes. Please do accept our apologies in the form on 150 Zepto coins!\\nFrequency & Timing of Campaign\\nThe notification should be sent one week after the last order. A reminder needs to be sent 15 days after if the user is still not resurrected!\\nSuccess Metrics\\n‚Üí % of users displaying old purchase frequency after 8 weeks\\n‚Üí WOW Retention curve\\nOther Micro Metrics To Track\\n‚Üí App Notification to Click Ratio\\n‚Üí Click to ‚ÄòAdd to cart‚Äô ratio\\nReasons this campaign will work\\n‚Üí By accepting the honest mistake and offering a reward, the core & power users will be happy to come back\\n‚Üí The Zepto coins will further incentivise them to give another chance to Zepto!\\nAssociated Risks\\n‚Üí If the order is delayed again, user may lose trust in the brand & may never come back again\\n‚Üí They may be further offended that we are trying to bring them back with cash incentives\\nYou can use the same framework to create multiple resurrection campaigns for all types of users. This level of depth will help you prioritise segments in a massive product like Zepto.\\nThe same framework can be used for all other voluntary and involuntary churn. As a growth person, your first priority is to understand the reasons and prioritise the solutions on the cohorts which will have the maximum impact.\\n6. Onboarding\\nSince we‚Äôve prioritised acquisition and engagement & Retention, we‚Äôre not going to focus on the other two levers on this guide. The superpower every growth person must have is the ability to say ‚ÄòNO‚Äô and prioritise with laser focus.\\nEven if you have infinite resources to handle, you need to have focus. Focus will help you solve the most important problems effectively. Moreover focus will help you reach your revenue goals effectively!\\nBut if you were to work on the Onboarding lever, here are some metrics you could track\\nDownload Metrics\\nAdd to basket metrics\\nCheckout metrics\\n‚Üí Channel wise download metrics:\\nAds to Downloads\\nFacebook ads to app download\\nIG Ads to app download\\nOrganic to download\\nGoogle search to download\\nGoogle play store search to download\\nApp store search to download\\n‚Üí Add to basket metrics:\\nNumber of download to registration\\nNumber of registrations to ‚ÄòVisited Homepage‚Äô\\nNumber of ‚ÄòVisited Homepage‚Äô to ‚ÄòAdd Items to cart‚Äô\\nNumber of ‚ÄòAdd Items to cart‚Äô to ‚ÄòVisited Checkout Page‚Äô\\n‚Üí Checkout Metrics:\\nNumber of items added to cart\\nNumber of categories added to cart\\nAverage order value\\nNumber of users checked out out with COD\\nNumber of users checked out with Credit Cards\\nNumber of users checked out with UPI\\n‚Üí All these metrics can also be further divided into\\nDevice\\nPlatform\\nAcquisition channel\\nDark Store\\nGeographical Location\\nTime\\netc‚Ä¶\\nThis is a very broad list of metrics you can track to understand your users. As always the metrics you choose will be dependant on your current revenue goals and business priorities.\\n7. Monetisation\\nFinally, the most important, yet looked upon growth lever is the monetisation lever. Revenue should never be an afterthought for any business. Since this lever is also not a priority at the moment, we are not going to deep dive into it.\\nEven before you work on your monetisation lever, you have to run the ‚ÄòLitmus Test‚Äô to understand your retention. Monetisation only works if atleast a certain subset of your users retain after a certain period of time.\\nOnce the litmus test is cleared, the monetisation lever has four categories\\nWho to charge?\\nWhen to charge?\\nWhat to charge?\\nHow much to charge?\\nand that‚Äôs all about the Growth levers for Zepto.\\nüí°\\nBy the way, the depth you see here is just a feeler of the depth we teach at GrowthX üí´\\nGrowthX is an invite-only club of over 3000 members who are product, marketing, and business leaders, and founders from top internet-first companies like Google, Canva, CRED, Stripe, Netflix, and more üíé\\nWe teach our members how to scale revenues via frameworks that can be applied starting next Monday morning.

Why is Zepto well positioned to win?\\nZepto has grown at breakneck speeds and we truly believe that can win in the long term. Here are some reasons why\\n1. Huge market that‚Äôs growing exponentially:\\nThe Indian economy is growing at an exponential pace. What happened in the west 20 years back is happening in India currently. As more capital is being poured into the country, new businesses are being formed every day. This leads to a surplus of capital in the economy.\\nCapital that can be used to deploy to make you life easier, like buy groceries from Zepto, instead of going to a shop nearby.\\nThe picture below shows an estimate of how the Indian economy will grow in the next 25 years.\\nThis is the macro shift that BigBasket definitely missed in its formative years.\\n2. Customer trust with internet products is growing exponentially:\\nThe Indian consumer segment are slowly starting to understand and trust internet products. Before Ola, Flipkart, Myntra and other startups came into play, spending money on the internet was a challenge. And it was not because of the lack of money\\nPeople still had disposable income, but the trust levels were quite low. No one were accustomed to spending money on these consumer apps.\\nThe advent of internet apps, paired with JIO and UPI changed this game.\\nSpending money on the internet became an everyday thing and this naturally improved the trust levels of consumers. Zepto is well positioned at a time where consumer trust on these internet startups is growing exponentially.\\n3. Backed by an experienced leadership team:\\nThere‚Äôs a reason why Zepto went from zero to 2000+ employees in a matter of two years. Right from the get go, the founders were keen on hiring experienced leader for their management team.\\nThey hired folks who had already done that startup journey in the same or a related field. Some of their most senior hires were\\nTheir CFO, Jitendra N was already a VP of Finance at Pharmeasy\\nTheir CBO, Viral Jhaveri had worked leadership roles in Uber Eats and FreighTigers\\nTheir People function is headed by Roma Bindroo handled the people function at Johnson & Johnson for multiple years\\nThe founders understood that Zepto is still an operations heavy business with some software at the front. Even if they make the software 100x better, the operations cannot be avoided.\\nThey understood the game and started hiring folks who understood operations heavy businesses in the first place. This allowed them to reduce mistakes and scale faster than ever!\\nüöÄ\\nIf you‚Äôre a leader or a founder, keen to hire the Top 1% Growth Talent in India, do register to our waiting list here. We have helped 100+ top startups like CRED, PayTm, Swiggy & Dunzo hire their Growth talent.\\nPlease do fill out the form and one of our Talent Team superstars will reach back to you üí™üèº\\n4. Changing customer behaviour:\\nWith the boom of the economy, customer behaviour is also changing constantly. More customers are now starting to value Convenience >> Money.\\nStartups like Swiggy, Uber, Urban Company are a true testament to this!\\n5. High driver retention rate:\\nZepto has a 7% higher delivery driver retention rate than all hyperlocal delivery startups in India. This is because of a couple of reasons\\nZero long distance deliveries - Drivers hate nothing more than long distance deliveries\\nA centralised hub for all drivers - Since Zepto operates only out of dark stores, this gives them a chance to provide a designated waiting area for delivery partners. The founder mentioned that they also provide their partners with water, snacks & otehr condiments to make their life easier.\\nWhile 7% maybe a marginal amount, it can eventually add up. Driver experience is a key piece in winning this hyperlocal war. Since there is no penalty or drivers when they jump ships, the player who retains the most, eventually wins in the long term.\\n6. High NPS:\\nZepto was founded on the core insight of high NPS from the days of Kiranakart (their old startup). Basically customers who received their orders in less than 15 minutes had a higher NPS compared to customers who got it later.\\nSince Zepto is built on this core insight, their NPS is close to 80% (which is spectacular)\\n7. High Customer Retention rate:\\nYet again, during the days of Kiranakart, the founders realised that customers who recieved orders in less than 15 minutes retained better. The 15 min delivery is a WOW factor, around which Zepto is entirely built out of.\\nThis helps them own a retention rate of 60% even with 2 million+ customers & growing!\\n8. Wave 2 startups FTW:\\nWave 1 startups are the BigBaskets and Flipkarts of India. They faced a lot of challenges in terms of the MACRO\\nTalent\\nEconomical Growth\\nConsumer Trust\\nPayments\\nConsumer Sentiment etc\\nIn the last 10 years however, the entire Macro of India has shifted in favour of startups üëáüèº\\nThe talent pool has become denser (lots of people who have been there and done that)\\nThe economy has grown and is growing by leaps and bounds\\nThe people have more trust on Internet startups\\nPaying for something has become incredibly easier (thanks to UPI and all the Fintech startups)\\nConsumer have started spending more money rather than just saving it\\n9. They have solved for delivery accuracy:\\nA big challenge with old age grocery delivery startups is order accuracy. Issues like missing some items or even delivering the wrong items is terrible customer experience. The customer on the other end orders grocieries for convenience. Missed or wrong deliveries is probably the most inconvenient thing for them.\\nThe founding team developed Zepto with a razer focus of delivering the right order on time. The pay close attention to the dispatch process and fill any leaks to prevent wrong deliveries.\\nOther incumbents like Swiggy Instamart, BigBasket have also fixed this in the recent days. Should be interesting to see how they fare against Zepto in the future.\\n10. Expanding to new locations:\\nZepto‚Äôs founder mentioned in an interview is doubling in business every three months. This is possible because of their rapid expansion to new locations with a ton of darkstores. Since their inception, Zepto has grown from one store in Mumbai to 75+ locations across Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata and other tier 1 metro cities.\\nThis has been possible because of an experienced management team and high focus on creating formalised processes for everything!\\n11. Expanding to different categories:\\nZepto started with just groceries, but now they‚Äôve expanded to beauty accessories, baby products and even electronics. As they slowly figure out the supply chain and formulate the entire process, they can add more categories to this. An example could be umbrellas & raincoats during monsoon.\\nThe sky is the limit when they have the supply chain figured out for everything.\\n12. Execution On Point:\\nGrocery delivery is not a huge innovation. BigBasket and many other incumbents have already done it and grown massively. Even the 15 min delivery can be figured out by other players in a matter of time.\\nThe biggest strength of team Zepto is their ability to execute. Momentum is a very sneaky element that exponentially increases your success.\\nWhile other players are changing their business model to fit the 10 min delivery, Zepto is already acing it. The first mover advantage alone will carry them far above the finish line. By providing an incredible service, they can retain to all their customers while other incumbents are still building for the market.\\n5. What are the reasons Zepto might also lose in the hyper competitive grocery space?\\nThere are always two sides to any coin. If there are a couple of reasons why Zepto will win, there are even more reasons as to why it might lose. We wouldn‚Äôt do justice to this guide without looking at those points too!\\n1. Expanding to Tier 2 cities will be a challenge:\\nTier 1 cities currently contribute to almost the entire revenue of Zepto. Last time we checked, there were no Zepto owned darkstores in tier 2+ cities. Zepto will reach a plateau as they expand across all tier 1 cities.\\nThey can only unlock even more growth when they reach tier 2 cities. However tier 2+ cities are built different in terms of\\nPopulation distribution\\nMindset\\nCustomer sentiment\\nBuilding Zepto for tier 2+ cities will require a whole different mindset that the current model. They will have to rethink everything which will require time & a lot of money.\\n2. Not all dark stores will be profitable:\\nThe cold truth is that not all darkstores will be profitable. Power laws can be crazy in business and a small percentage of the dark stores may end up generating the most amount of revenue.\\nThe hard part about this is each darkstore, irrespective of revenue will have a fixed operating cost. This will be split between\\nSalaries\\nRent\\nOther bills\\nSo at some point Zepto will have to decide between closing low revenue locations or keeping them alive for just overall brand visibility.\\n3. White-labelling products is an operational challenge:\\nThere is only so much you can earn from selling other brands. That‚Äôs exactly why so many supermarkets end up creating their own products like rice, oil, bread etc..\\nIt allows them to control the supply chain and take a bigger share of the revenue pie.\\nHowever producing your own products is also investment heavy. While production is the first challenge, Quality Control & Branding is an even bigger challenge. Acquisitions can come in handy for this play.\\nWe‚Äôll just have to wait and see how Zepto play this card out!\\n4. Free Delivery might hit on the margins:\\nWhile ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô is great for the growth stage, it is not sustainable for overall sustenance. At some point, Zepto will have to cut down on ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô. Or they might also need to increase the minimum threshold for ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô.\\nThis might lead to a drop in order frequency and users jumping to competitor products who do offer ‚Äò Free Delivery‚Äô.\\n5. Zero Cost Of Switching:\\nThe biggest problem with hyperlocal startups like this is the switching cost. Or should we say that there isn‚Äôt say.\\nWhat is a switching cost?\\nIt is the cost a customer has to pay when they decide to use another application. For example, when someone decided to use another SaaS app, the switching cost is loss of data. If they decide to play another game, they will end up losing all their progress and having to start from scratch.\\nEssentially, switching cost is a hidden cost that prevents a customer from using another app.\\nSince there is ‚ÄòZero Switching Costs‚Äô customer can have all of their competeitors on the phone and order from anyone of required. If they get one or two bad experiences, they might immediately jump to a competeitor.\\nIf BigBasket can also consistently deliver in under 15 minutes, Zepto is no longer a ‚Äòmust-have‚Äô but a ‚ÄòGood to have‚Äô.\\n6. 10 min model is replicable:\\nOne big IP risk is that their min model is incredible 10 in delivery can be implemented by anyone. All they need is some capital to frontload their darkstore and they‚Äôre good to go. To Retain customers in the long run, Zepto will have to keep providing on their promise of quick delivery.\\n7. Change in government regulations:\\nA lot of things need to go right for internet startups to succeed in India. Once such thing are the government regulations. As of now, Zepto can classify their drivers as partners and not employees. This allows them to pay their drivers like a consultant rather than an employee.\\nThis also includes all drivers who operate with Swiggy, Zomato and other delivery partners.\\nIf one day, the government mandates that they should also be treated as employees, it will mess with their entire P&L and might even sink the business.\\n8. Lose out on the waiting game\\nThe team behind is executing well, but can they maintain it for the long term. Old players like BigBasket are flush with an instream of capital from the TATA group. While Zepto is dependant on investor money to stay afloat. Sure, most of their darkstores eventually ramp up and start earning revenue.\\nBut what if players like BigBasket decide to cut Zepto on delivery costs & margins?\\nThis will be a long game where Zepto can only win if they are fiscally discipline and provide a stellar experience.\\nThese are some of the reasons we think Zepto might fail in the next 2 - 5 years.\\nHowever no one can predict the future and these are all just speculations up to this point. But as a growth and business person, it is your job to constantly speculate, hypothesise and play the devil‚Äôs advocate to future proof your business.\\nWe hope you enjoyed reading this blog.\\nüöÄ\\nIf you have any feedback, please do leave them in the TypeForm here. We want to make this blog 100X better for you, so we take all your feedback seriously!\\n                \\n                Zepto, a quick-commerce startup founded in 2021 by Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, has disrupted the Indian grocery delivery market with its promise of delivering essentials within 10 minutes. The company has rapidly scaled up to become one of the most recognized names in the ultra-fast grocery delivery segment. In this article, we‚Äôll take a deep dive into Zepto‚Äôs business model, revenue streams, and the strategies that fuel its success.\\nZepto‚Äôs Business Model Overview\\nZepto operates on a quick-commerce (q-commerce) model, which focuses on delivering groceries and daily essentials to customers in ultra-short time frames. Unlike traditional grocery e-commerce players, Zepto‚Äôs unique selling point lies in its 10-minute delivery promise. Here‚Äôs how its model is structured:\\na.

This innovative approach, where groceries and essential items are delivered in under 10 minutes, began as a novel concept but has rapidly evolved into a substantial business model. Central to this growth is the Zepto business model and digital marketing strategy, which has played a vital role in building the brand and driving customer engagement.\\nIt‚Äôs true ‚Äì Companies like Zepto are at the forefront of this revolution, with even major corporations like Reliance recognising the potential and getting involved. However, despite its rapid expansion, the quick commerce industry faces considerable challenges, especially in terms of profitability.\\nThis article delves into how companies like Zepto are striving for success, the obstacles they encounter, and what the future might hold.\\nBut before we get into it, a quick side note ‚Äì If you‚Äôre the kind of person who loves decoding marketing strategies, exploring digital marketing masters courses or enrolling in an online digital marketing course can provide valuable insights into this dynamic field.\\nLearn Digital Marketing for FREE\\n- 45 Mins Masterclass\\n- Watch Anytime, Anywhere\\n- 1,00,000+ Students Enrolled\\nSo, What is Quick Commerce?\\nQuick commerce, or Q-commerce, revolves around delivering products like groceries at lightning speed‚Äîtypically within 30 minutes. The success of this model hinges on dark stores which are small warehouses strategically located close to customers. These warehouses typically store popular items that can be dispatched rapidly.\\nFor example, when you order everyday essentials like bread, eggs, and milk, a nearby dark store can have these items packed and en route to you within minutes. This sets quick commerce apart from traditional online shopping, where products may take days to arrive as they are shipped from distant warehouses.\\nThe business model of Zepto heavily depends on this approach, with dark stores being crucial for ensuring fast delivery times. This quick turnaround is a fundamental aspect of the Zepto grocery business model, which prioritises speed and convenience to attract customers.\\nIf you‚Äôre interested in how business models are developed, consider reading our digital marketing blogs and digital marketing case studies.\\nHow Dark Stores Work\\nDark stores serve as the foundation of quick commerce, enabling the rapid delivery of products. Unlike traditional grocery stores that serve walk-in customers, dark stores are dedicated exclusively to fulfilling online orders.\\nTypically located within 1.5 to 4 kilometres of the customers they serve, these stores are optimised for fast, efficient service.\\nFor instance, if you live in a bustling neighbourhood, there‚Äôs likely a dark store nearby stocked with everyday items. Once you place an order, the products are quickly picked, packed, and dispatched‚Äîoften within minutes. This process is streamlined by advanced technology that assists workers in these stores to complete orders efficiently.\\nThe Zepto business model pdf available online provides a comprehensive overview of how these dark stores operate and how they contribute to the overall efficiency of the business. Understanding the Zepto business model is essential for anyone looking to explore the quick commerce sector.\\nP.S. Want to become a digital marketer or work in e-commerce? Enrolling in digital marketing classes or one of the best online marketing courses can equip you with the necessary skills to succeed in this fast-paced industry.\\nMaking Quick Commerce Profitable\\nRunning a dark store is not without its costs. Setting up such a store can range from ‚Çπ25 to ‚Çπ40 lakh, with each store requiring a staff of around 13 to 14 employees. In this industry, the average order value is between ‚Çπ350 and ‚Çπ400, with gross profit margins typically ranging from 15% to 20%.\\nHowever, achieving profitability is challenging. Gross profit represents the revenue generated before accounting for expenses like rent, salaries, and delivery costs.\\nFor instance, if the delivery cost of an order is ‚Çπ40 and the gross profit is ‚Çπ80, the net profit is only ‚Çπ40. This underscores the importance of careful cost management in the quick commerce industry.\\nThis meticulous approach to managing costs and operations is a cornerstone of the Zepto revenue model, which has enabled the company to scale rapidly in a competitive market. The efficiency of the Zepeto business model (often misspelt as ‚ÄúZepeto‚Äù) is what distinguishes it from traditional retail models.\\nFun fact: If you‚Äôre aiming to build a profitable business, studying various business models, especially those regarded as the most profitable business in India, can offer valuable insights. Zepto‚Äôs success story provides a blueprint for what works in the Indian market.\\nThe Challenges of Quick Commerce\\n1) Balancing Costs and Profits\\nOne of the primary challenges facing quick commerce companies is maintaining sufficient profit margins. Even major players like D-Mart report profit margins of only around 16%.\\nFor companies like Zepto, which incur additional costs for rapid deliveries, achieving and maintaining profitable margins is particularly challenging.\\nConducting a Zepto SWOT analysis is crucial for understanding the company‚Äôs strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and potential risks. This analysis can reveal areas where the company excels and where it may need to improve.\\nFor instance, a Zepto SWOT analysis might highlight the company‚Äôs proficiency in fast delivery while also identifying challenges related to customer acquisition costs.\\n2) Competing with Local Stores\\nMany consumers have a local store within walking distance that offers free delivery. If quick commerce companies cannot deliver quickly or fail to maintain product freshness, customers may prefer to shop locally.\\nFor example, if Zepto takes more than 30 minutes to deliver groceries, a customer might opt to visit the nearby store instead. This competition from local stores is a significant challenge for quick commerce companies.\\nHowever, the Zepto marketing strategy has been instrumental in overcoming this challenge. By emphasising the convenience and speed of their services, the Zepto marketing campaign has successfully drawn in a large customer base.\\nThe effectiveness of the Zepto digital marketing strategy has been crucial in retaining customer loyalty despite stiff competition.\\nIf you‚Äôre looking to explore digital marketing in greater detail, consider taking digital marketing courses in Mumbai or digital marketing courses in Faridabad. Both cities offer highly regarded courses in this field.\\nAlternatively, digital marketing courses in Thrissur are also an excellent choice if you‚Äôre based in southern India.\\n3) Customer Habits and Order Size\\nQuick commerce apps are frequently used for small, spontaneous purchases. For example, someone making a sandwich might order just bread, cheese, and tomatoes. These small orders make it challenging for companies to turn a profit. If companies try to impose a minimum order value, they risk diminishing the convenience factor that attracts users to quick commerce in the first place.\\nTo address this, the Zepto promotion strategy often includes discounts and special offers that encourage customers to add additional items to their carts, thus boosting the average order value. This strategy is a key part of the Zepto business plan aimed at boosting profitability.\\nUnderstanding consumer behaviour and the role of AI in this process is becoming increasingly important. Exploring the role of AI in content creation can offer insights into how companies like Zepto can personalise marketing strategies to better meet customer needs.\\n4) New Competitors\\nNew apps are emerging that offer similar services by connecting customers directly with local stores. For instance, ‚ÄòMy Kirana‚Äô in Pune allows customers to order from their local kirana stores via an app, ensuring fast delivery without the need to use Zepto. These apps pose a potential threat by taking away customers from established quick commerce platforms.\\nThe Future of Quick Commerce\\nOpportunities and Risks\\nThe quick commerce industry holds great promise but also faces significant challenges. Companies that can effectively address these challenges‚Äîby controlling delivery costs, increasing order sizes, and competing with local stores‚Äîare poised to become major players in the retail industry.\\nThe long-term success of Zepto will depend on its ability to adapt and refine its strategies. As the market continues to evolve, the business model of Zepto must remain flexible to respond to new opportunities and challenges.\\nCould Big Companies Take Over?\\nThere is also the possibility that large corporations like Reliance or D-Mart might acquire quick commerce companies like Zepto. These giants have the resources and supply chains to run such services more efficiently. For instance, if Reliance were to acquire Zepto, it could leverage Zepto‚Äôs delivery network to distribute its own products faster and at a lower cost.\\nShould such an acquisition occur, the Zepto marketing strategy would likely be significantly enhanced, integrating seamlessly with the extensive resources of a company like Reliance. This could potentially revolutionise the way quick commerce operates.\\nFor those interested in understanding how such market shifts could play out, attending afree LinkedIn essentials masterclass or exploring a free top paying skills course could provide valuable insights.\\nWant to Know Why 2,50,000+ Students Trust Us?\\nDive into the numbers that make us the #1 choice for career success\\nCourses Recommended for you\\nAditya Shastri leads the Business Development segment at IIDE and is a seasoned Content Marketing expert.

The Zepto business model works within the quick commerce segment in India.\\nBusiness Plan\\nThe Zepto business model promises to deliver your grocery in 10 minutes. Zepto‚Äôs network of ‚Äúcloud shops‚Äù or ‚Äúmicro-warehouses‚Äù allows the company to fill orders quickly and efficiently. Zepto business model is based on the ‚Äúdark store model.‚Äù This involves setting up warehouse-style stores in residential areas that are only accessible to delivery drivers. The stores contain a range of products, and customers can only order via the Zepto India app or website. Zepto currently has over 86+ dark stores in various locations. While dark stores are designed for instant deliveries, they can‚Äôt always handle high sales volume.\\nZepto has places called dark stores or micro fulfillment centers that lie in higher-demand neighborhoods. These dark stores use technology for performing tasks such as the placement of products. Some other tasks they perform include deciding the store locations, and mapping delivery routes for avoiding heavy traffic congestions. The company is already delivering items that include cooking necessities, fresh produce, personal care items, snacks and beverages, and home cleaning items.\\n- Faster delivery and enhanced distribution\\n- Raise customer reach\\n- Contactless shopping\\n- Enhanced Product Assortment and Inventory\\nThese facilities, which allow the company to fulfill its ten-minute promise on up to 90% of orders, possess the following characteristics:\\n- They are not open to the public.\\n- They are located in high-demand neighborhoods.\\n- They stock only the most commonly ordered items.\\n- They are ergonomically designed to ensure order packers can move as swiftly and efficiently as possible.\\nRevenue Model\\nZepto makes money by charging a commission fee from the grocery stores for every order placed through the app. Additionally, Zepto may charge a delivery fee from the customers for the delivery service.\\nMargins on each individual product\\nHandling Charges\\nProduct Customizations\\nProduct Ads\\nMembership\\nBy subscribing to their membership, you can get\\n- Free deliveries on all orders\\n- No surge fees\\n- Better discounts\\nCompetitors\\nSWOT Analysis\\nStrengths\\n‚Ä¢ Excellent usage of technology: With the assistance of www.locus.sh Zepto records its customers‚Äô geographical data, traffic dynamics, delivery time, and so on.

They are Zepto‚Äô s most valuable resource since they are well informed about the market. Palicha and Vohra, the co-founders, did a fantastic job in creating their team.\\n‚Ä¢ Strong financial support: Zepto is well-funded, which allows it to expand and grow into a market leader. They currently have a total funding of $360 million.\\n‚Ä¢ Being true to their objective: Zepto ensures that their customers‚Äô expectations are met by delivering goods in 10 minutes.

They need to grow their sales while decreasing some of their expenditures to make their business profitable.\\n‚Ä¢ Reliance on retailers: Zepto‚Äôs business strategy is primarily dependent on other businesses and their inventory.

Customers swing from one app to the next like a pendulum. Because there is little consumer loyalty, Zepto must continually stay on top of their game.\\n- Exploitation of delivery boys: There are several sceptics of the quick commerce industry. Delivery boys are exploited in the name of quick delivery and are subjected to extreme strain, increasing the likelihood of an accident.\\nConclusion\\nZepto is a detail-oriented and intense business with strong technical and operating discipline that allows them to pull off the 10-minute delivery. Zepto is looking to offer its service to more countries. This company is planning to cover about 100 pin codes. The fastest delivery is a fresh idea.

Well, they are \\nnot newbies in the start -up world, this is their third start -up after GoPool and Kiranakart.  They came with \\nthis ground-breaking idea while sitting in their homes and waiting for their groceries to be delivered in 2 -3 \\ndays. Zepto belongs to those start -up subgroups that experienced meteoric development in the post -\\nCovid period. This case explains the developme nt process of how the company is making it possible to \\ndeliver items in 10 minutes. Zepto has raised $360 million in funding with the lead investors being the \\nAmerican start up accelerator company Y Combinator and the American growth equity firm Glade Broo k \\nCapital Partners. Currently, the company has a valuation of $900 million. 1 So, the possibility that Zepto  \\nwill soon turn into a unicorn is not a daft idea. However, there is a major concern surrounding Zepto‚Äô s \\nbusiness model as they have still not made the business profitable. Zepto is also facing tough \\ncompetition from its rival Blinkit (formerly known as Grofers) who was founded in December 2013. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\n \\nKeywords: Zepto, Start-up, E-commerce, Business Model, Post-Covid. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\n \\nIntroduction \\n Zepto is a quick e-commerce company that started its operations in 2021. \\n The company started its operations in Bandra, Mumbai and has subsequently extended its \\ndelivery areas to Pune, Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Ghaziabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata. \\n On October 31, 2021, a total of 8 investors, led by Glade Brook Capital Partners, invested in \\nthem $60 million after which more investors began to notice them. Later, they raised additional funding \\nthrough their series C and series D rounds. Y Combinator Continuity Fund became the major investor in \\nboth of these rounds. \\n The Series C and D rounds were held on December 20, 2021 and May 2, 2022 and raised $100 \\nmillion and $200 million respectively2.But Zepto is not the only quick commerce start-up that is backed by \\nstrong funding, it is up against fierce competition in India from Blinkit. Blinkit has received backing from \\n24 investor s and has gone through a total of 19 fundraising rounds. Blinkit is currently valued at $1 \\nbillion3. And then there is also Dunzo which is backed by Google. \\nZepto‚Äô s tagline is \"Groceries delivered in 10 minutes‚Äù. They do this with the help of Dark stores . \\nThey are nothing but warehouses that are not open to the public and are located in such area in the \\nneighbourhood where demand is high.Only commonly requested commodities are kept in these \\nwarehouses, preventing the loss of unsold stock. Zepto‚Äô s dark st ores are designed in a way so that \\norders are filled as rapidly as possible, effectively and efficiently reducing time. Currently, Zepto is \\ndelivering 2500+ goods, including food and drink, personal care products, fresh produce, home cleaning \\nsupplies, and  snacks and beverages, from its 100+ dark stores. As stated by the CEO of zepto  Aadit \\nPalicha the average delivery time taken by Zepto is 8 minutes and 47 seconds. \\n \\n\\uf02a Supervisor, Mentor &Associate Professor, Department of Commerce, Daulat Ram College, University of \\nDelhi, Delhi, India. \\n**  Student pursuing B.

The company uses artificial intelligence (AI) t o \\nenhance the effectiveness of its delivery network by taking into account variables like weather, traffic \\npatterns, population, geography, and the availability of last-mile supplies. \\n The co-founders have managed to make the roots of the company strong by  getting the best \\ntalent out there to work for them when they first started building a team.  They were successful in \\npersuading a number of high-profile executives from Dream 11, Amazon, Uber, Pharmeasy, and Flipkart. \\n(Source: LinkedIn) \\nThese qualified exe cutives have assisted Zepto in achieving unit economics and capital \\nefficiency. They are what have allowed Zepto to carve out a place for itself in the grocery‚Äôs delivery \\nmarket. \\nFindings  \\nGroceries account for the majority of India\\'s $1 trillion retail market.1 Consequently, this market \\nhas enormous potential. During Corona, it was challenging to leave the house every time you wanted to \\nbuy a small essential item, and today with people having to work for long hours, especially in urban cities, \\nit is challenging to go out and shop for daily groceries. The market needed an app like Zepto more than it \\nwanted one, thus its release was ideal. These apps help customers to save their time  and make their life \\neasier. As of right now, as mentioned by the C EO of zepto, they receive 100,000 orders each day, and \\ntheir demand curve is essentially flat. They once more turn to technology to determine the ideal location \\nfor their tiny fulfilment centres. \\nAlthough some would believe that Zepto‚Äô s delivery speed is what sets them apart from the \\ncompetition, this is not the case. The key element that sets zepto apart from its rivals is not the quickness \\nof the delivery men, but rather how effectively it uses technology. Zepto tracks its customers\\' spatial data, \\ntraffic dynamics, the time it takes to deliver the items, etc. with the aid of www.locus.sh. They collect this \\ndata and analyse it to decide whether they need more dark stores in the area to be able to achieve that \\n10-minute goal. \\nZepto Generates Income in Two Ways \\n‚Ä¢ It first negotiates a profit margin with the companies based on how much of their product is kept \\nin the warehouse. \\n‚Ä¢ Second, they make money by charging companies for ad space and the top search results. \\n‚Ä¢ Zepto had total revenue of INR 142.3 Cr in FY22, while incurring costs of INR 532.7 Cr. They \\nsuffered a loss of 390.3 Cr INR as a result. \\nMarketing costs make up the majority of their spending \\nThey invest a lot of money in promoting and advertising their app. During FY22, they spent INR \\n175.5 Cr, or almo st 33% of their overall expenses on marketing. In addition to this, the firm spent INR \\n213.2 Cr on stock -in-trade purchases in FY22. Employee benefits cost INR 50.3 Cr, while supply chain \\ncosts were INR 74 Cr.2 \\nZepto‚Äô s EBITDA margin in FY22 was -259.39%.3An EBITDA offers a clear picture of the \\ncompany\\'s worth and displays it to potential buyers and investors. Unfortunately, Zepto‚Äô s EBITDA is \\nnegative. \\n To distribute the products, Zepto utilizes gig workers. These individuals make an average \\nincome of INR 1,30,211.4 \\n Zepto has been able to outperform the competition because of its business model. They have a \\nhighly effective distribution system, and Zepto‚Äô s AI-powered tools make it simple to manage and keep an \\neye on inventory and product selection. This leads to better in ventory management and a wider range of \\nproducts. Additionally, they have a large consumer base that is constantly growing. \\n \\n1  https://www.statista.com/statistics/1021352/india-organized-retail-market-value/https://www.statista.com/topics/5615/food-retail-in \\nindia/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20the%20food%20and%20grocery,retail%20market%20at%2063%20percent . \\n2  https://www.vccircle.com/zeptounlikely-to-turn-profitable-in-near-term \\n3  https://inc42.com/buzz/zepto-incurs-inr-390-cr-loss-in-first-year-of-operations-fy22-sales-at-inr-\\n141r/#:~:text=Zepto%2C%20which%20began%20operations%20in,stood%20at%20INR%20140.7%20Cr . \\n4  https://www.ambitionbox.com/salaries/zepto-salaries/delivery-boy \\x0cDr. Sunita Gupta & Avani Pandey: Just in 10 Minutes: A Case Study on Zepto 195 \\nDiscussion \\n Zepto is indeed facing losses but it is only natural for a fledgling enterprise in their early years of \\noperations to incur some loss.  While Zepto has suffered losses, it is still in a better situation than Blinkit \\nand Dunzo, which have suffered losses of INR 1,019 Cr and INR 464 Cr respectively.1 \\nThe quick commerce industry has a customer base that is not very devoted, s o even if delivery \\ntime increases by a few minutes, customers will still go where they can obtain the best deals. \\n Zepto has to strike a balance between discounts and deals and keep their delivery time between \\n10 and 20 minutes. Blinkit is their sole main rival at the moment in this market. They need to start \\npenetrating into newer cities if they want to distinctly emerge as the leaders of quick commerce. \\nZepto has to diversify its revenue streams and stop relying solely on a limited range of sources. \\nAccording to the founders of Zepto, they are planning to open a Zepto caf√© that will provide popular \\nbrand‚Äôs coffee and tea. If it were to become a reality, it may  be successful since metropolitan city\\'s youth \\nrun on caffeine, and hitting up chaayos or blue tokaievery time you feel like drinking one is impractical. If \\nZepto wants to make this business a success, they will need more funding. Since Zepto has already \\nestablished a reputation for itself and everything associated with that name would benefit from its \\ngoodwill, their marketing costs shouldn\\'t be too high. \\nZepto, as well as any other rapid commerce start -up, solely receives criticism for how it treats \\ndelivery guys. Due to the shorter time constraints these workers must adhere to, they may drive rashly, \\nincreasing the chances of accidents.  Zepto, however, refutes these criticisms by pointing to their \\nadvanced technology, which enables the driver to arrive at the destination both securely and on time. \\nSWOT Analysis \\nStrengths \\n‚Ä¢ Excellent usage of technology:  With the assistance of www.locus.sh Zepto records its \\ncustomers\\' geographical data, traffic dynamics, delivery time, and so on. They gather and \\nevaluate this data to determine whether more dark establishments are needed in the region to \\nmeet the 10-minute objective. \\n‚Ä¢ Being true to their objective:  Zepto ensures that their customers\\' expectations are met by \\ndelivering goods in 10 minutes. Zepto achieves their ai m 90% of the time, which contributes to \\nbrand loyalty. \\n‚Ä¢ Strong financial support:  Zepto is well -funded, which allows it to expand and grow into a \\nmarket leader. They currently have a total funding of $360 million. \\n‚Ä¢ Competent Workforce: The effective management of Zepto is in the hands of highly skilled and \\nexperienced professionals. They are Zepto‚Äô s most valuable resource since they are well -\\ninformed about the market. Palicha and Vohra, the co -founders, did a fantastic job in creating \\ntheir team. \\nWeakness \\n‚Ä¢ Reliance on retailers: Zepto‚Äôs business strategy is primarily dependent on other businesses \\nand their inventory. When a retailer\\'s stock is unavailable, customers may be forced to select a \\nhigher-priced substitution or go without buying that item from them. \\n‚Ä¢ Fluctuating customer base:  To keep their clientele, Zepto must find a balance between their \\ndiscount strategy and keeping their delivery time under 10 minutes. \\n‚Ä¢ Net Income: Zepto‚Äôs operational costs are high. They need to grow their sales while decreasing  \\nsome of their expenditures to make their business profitable. \\n‚Ä¢ Nothing Unique: Zepto‚Äôs business strategy is not very unique, and any company may enter this \\nmarket and replicate it. \\n \\n1  https://www.vccircle.com/blinkits-marketplace-arm-s-fy22-loss-widens-to-over-rs-1-000-\\ncrore#:~:text=Blinkit\\'s%20marketplace%20arm\\'s%20FY22%20loss%20widens%20to%20over%20Rs%201%2C000%20crore, -\\nBy%20Malvika%20Maloo&text=Zomato%2Downed%20Blinkit\\'s%20marketplace%20arm,on%20transportation%2C%20contract%\\n20and%20advertising. \\nhttps://inc42.com/buzz/dunzos-loss-widens-2x-to-inr-464-cr-in-fy22-as-expenses-also-double/#:~:text=Share%20story-\\n,Dunzo\\'s%20Loss%20Widens%202X%20To%20INR%20464,FY22%20As%20E xpenses%20Also%20Double&text=Bengaluru%2\\nDbased%20hyperlocal%20delivery%20platform,due%20to%20doubling%20of%20expenses . \\n \\x0c196 International Journal of Advanced Research in Commerce, Management & Social Science (IJARCMSS)  -October-December, 2022 \\nOpportunity \\n‚Ä¢ Infiltrating further into existing locations and entering fresh  cities: One way they can \\noutperform their competitors is to grow their business as quickly as possible. \\n‚Ä¢ Various Business Ventures:  Zepto has developed a brand identity for itself, which they can \\nnow utilize to enter into other sectors and diversify their revenue stream. \\nThreats \\nHeavy competition: Zepto is in a league with big names. Customers swing from one app to the \\nnext like a pendulum. Because there is little consumer loyalty, Zepto must continually stay on top of their \\ngame. \\n Exploitation of delivery boys: There are several sceptics of the quick commerce industry. \\nDelivery boys are exploited in the name of quick delivery and are subjected to extreme strain, increasing \\nthe likelihood of an accident. \\nConclusion  \\nSince its start in April 2021, Zepto has grown organically to become one of India\\'s most valuable \\nand promising start -ups. Zepto has everything a successful firm requires: a talented and dedicated \\nworkforce, solid funding, and the use of technology to operate rapidly. However, they cannot handle huge \\nsales volume since the dark stores they utilise for speedy delivery are not built to support large scale \\noperations. They  keep a limited number of fresh items in hand because if they are not sold, they will \\nsuffer losses as the items stale. As a result , there is a possibility that the consumer use competitor\\'s app \\nsince the things they want are out of stock. \\nOn the face of it, if Blinkit exists& grows, it is difficult for Zepto  to be the market leader. Both \\nhave a nearly identical business model, and Bl inkit‚Äô s delivery time is also less than 10 minutes so \\nactually they both don‚Äôt have anything unique that sets them apart. The only thing that can help Zepto to \\ncompete with Blinkit and become a stable business firm is expanding into more cities and having  a wider \\nrange of products to pick from. \\nZepto along with other apps is effectively breaking the mould of traditional purchasing and \\nestablishing an e-consumerism habit. There is no doubt that Zepto is now expanding faster than anybody \\nelse in this sector. They are detail-oriented and employ AI-based technologies well. \\nZepto is expected to become a unicorn in 2023. 1However, being a unicorn does not imply that \\nthe firm is profitable. \\nIn the FY22 their revenue was considerable, as seen by the number of orders they received \\neach day, but their operational costs were high and  hence they suffered losses. If they want to become a \\nprofitable firm, they must expand into newer cities while adhering to their basic principles and finding \\nmethods to reduce their operational expenses. \\nReferences  \\n1. https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto/news \\n2. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto \\n3. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zepto-29b1 \\n4. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/grofers-trusted-delivery-partner \\n5.

      "GeneratedAnswer(data='Okay, here\\'s an analysis of Zepto\\'s current business, technical, and marketing strategies, drawing upon available information.\\n\\n**I. Zepto\\'s Business Strategy**\\n\\nZepto operates in the highly competitive quick commerce (q-commerce) sector in India, focusing on ultra-fast delivery of groceries and essentials.\\n\\n1.  **Core Value Proposition:** The foundation of Zepto\\'s business is speed, initially built around the promise of 10-minute grocery delivery [[1](https://www.mindinventory.com/blog/zepto-business-model/)]. While optimizing operations, they maintain a focus on rapid delivery, typically within 10-20 minutes.\\n2.  **Dark Store Model:** Zepto utilizes a network of strategically located \"dark stores\" or micro-fulfillment centers. These are not open to the public but are optimized for quick picking and packing of orders within a limited radius [[1](https://www.mindinventory.com/blog/zepto-business-model/)] [[2](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/zepto-pivots-to-prioritise-profitability-over-10-minute-delivery-model/articleshow/101275109.cms)]. This dense network is crucial for enabling fast delivery times.\\n3.  **Target Market:** Primarily urban and semi-urban consumers who prioritize convenience and speed over potentially wider selections or slightly lower prices found in traditional supermarkets or slower e-commerce platforms [[1](https://www.mindinventory.com/blog/zepto-business-model/)].\\n4.  **Path to Profitability:** After initial rapid expansion focused on market share, Zepto has increasingly emphasized achieving positive unit economics and overall profitability. This involves optimizing delivery routes, improving supply chain efficiency, increasing average order value (AOV), and potentially introducing handling fees in some cases [[2](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/zepto-pivots-to-prioritise-profitability-over-10-minute-delivery-model/articleshow/101275109.cms)] [[4](https://inc42.com/buzz/zepto-to-raise-300-mn-funding-at-up-to-2-5-bn-valuation/)]. They achieved unicorn status in August 2023 after raising $200 million [[5](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/25/zepto-becomes-first-indian-unicorn-of-2023/)].\\n5.  **Expansion & Diversification:** Zepto has expanded its product categories beyond core groceries to include items like electronics, home essentials, and potentially beauty products, aiming to increase basket size and customer loyalty. They also launched \"Zepto Cafe\" in select locations, offering ready-to-drink coffee, tea, and snacks [[3](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/26/indias-zepto-widens-10-minute-delivery-offering-with-snacks-and-beverages/)].\\n\\n*   **Contribution to Growth:** The core 10-minute delivery promise was a powerful initial growth driver, attracting significant customer interest and venture capital.

Zepto\\'s Business Strategy**\\n\\nZepto operates in the highly competitive quick commerce (q-commerce) sector in India, focusing on ultra-fast delivery of groceries and essentials.\\n\\n1.  **Core Value Proposition:** The foundation of Zepto\\'s business is speed, initially built around the promise of 10-minute grocery delivery [[1](https://www.mindinventory.com/blog/zepto-business-model/)]. While optimizing operations, they maintain a focus on rapid delivery, typically within 10-20 minutes.\\n2.  **Dark Store Model:** Zepto utilizes a network of strategically located \"dark stores\" or micro-fulfillment centers. These are not open to the public but are optimized for quick picking and packing of orders within a limited radius [[1](https://www.mindinventory.com/blog/zepto-business-model/)] [[2](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/zepto-pivots-to-prioritise-profitability-over-10-minute-delivery-model/articleshow/101275109.cms)]. This dense network is crucial for enabling fast delivery times.\\n3.  **Target Market:** Primarily urban and semi-urban consumers who prioritize convenience and speed over potentially wider selections or slightly lower prices found in traditional supermarkets or slower e-commerce platforms [[1](https://www.mindinventory.com/blog/zepto-business-model/)].\\n4.  **Path to Profitability:** After initial rapid expansion focused on market share, Zepto has increasingly emphasized achieving positive unit economics and overall profitability. This involves optimizing delivery routes, improving supply chain efficiency, increasing average order value (AOV), and potentially introducing handling fees in some cases [[2](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/zepto-pivots-to-prioritise-profitability-over-10-minute-delivery-model/articleshow/101275109.cms)] [[4](https://inc42.com/buzz/zepto-to-raise-300-mn-funding-at-up-to-2-5-bn-valuation/)].

They also launched \"Zepto Cafe\" in select locations, offering ready-to-drink coffee, tea, and snacks [[3](https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/26/indias-zepto-widens-10-minute-delivery-offering-with-snacks-and-beverages/)].\\n\\n*   **Contribution to Growth:** The core 10-minute delivery promise was a powerful initial growth driver, attracting significant customer interest and venture capital.

Quick commerce, a $2.8-billion industry, has become an integral part of any consumer goods company\\\\\\'s distribution strategy.\\\\n                </search-result>\\\\n                \\\\n                \\\\n                Contents\\\\nIntroduction\\\\nWhen I first heard about Zepto promising delivery in 10 minutes, I thought it was a marketing gimmick. But then I tried it. A fresh loaf of bread and some eggs arrived in less time than it took me to finish an email.\\\\nNaturally, I had to dig deeper into how they‚Äôre pulling this off.\\\\nThe answer?\\\\nDark stores.\\\\nWhat Are Dark Stores?\\\\nA dark store is essentially a warehouse designed for e-commerce fulfillment rather than walk-in customers. Unlike a traditional grocery store, dark stores prioritize efficiency, stocking fast-moving consumer goods in a hyper-organized way to minimize the time needed for picking and packing.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs dark stores are strategically located to ensure they‚Äôre within a 2-3 km radius of their target customers. This proximity reduces last-mile delivery time‚Äîa crucial factor in achieving their ambitious 10-minute promise.\\\\nThe Genesis of Zepto‚Äôs Dark Store Model\\\\nThe concept of dark stores is relatively new in India, but its roots can be traced back to successful implementations in developed countries.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs founders, Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, recognized an opportunity to adapt this model for the Indian market.\\\\nWith over 200-250 dark stores strategically located across major cities like Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, and Chennai, Zepto has created a network that allows for rapid fulfillment of customer orders.\\\\nThese dark stores are designed to be efficient. The magic happens in less than 60 seconds from the moment an order is placed to when it is packed and ready for delivery. This is made possible through a combination of technology and human ingenuity.\\\\nEach store is equipped with a sophisticated inventory management system that ensures popular items are always in stock, allowing for swift picking and packing.\\\\nHow Dark Stores Work: The Math Behind the Magic\\\\nAt the heart of Zepto‚Äôs operations lies a well-oiled machine that combines logistics, technology, and customer insights. Here‚Äôs how it works:\\\\n- Strategic Location: Dark stores are placed within close proximity to high-demand neighborhoods. This ensures that the average delivery distance is approximately 1.8 km, significantly reducing travel time.\\\\n- Efficient Picking and Packing: Employees use handheld devices that guide them through the most efficient routes within the store to collect items quickly. The entire process‚Äîfrom picking to packing‚Äîtakes about 58 seconds, which is crucial for maintaining the 10-minute delivery promise.\\\\n- Real-Time Tracking: Once an order is packed, delivery personnel equipped with real-time tracking systems ensure that customers receive their groceries as quickly as possible. Zepto reports an average delivery time of 8 minutes and 47 seconds, which is impressive by any standard.\\\\nThe Financial Backbone: Cost Structure and Revenue\\\\nOperating dark stores does come with its challenges, particularly concerning cost management. According to Palicha, running a dark store typically costs about 5-10% of revenue, covering expenses like rent, utilities, and employee wages. This low overhead allows Zepto to maintain competitive pricing while still investing in expansion.\\\\nHowever, profitability remains a long-term goal rather than an immediate reality. While Zepto could achieve profitability by halting its expansion plans, the company is focused on growth‚Äîplanning to open more dark stores and expand its product offerings beyond groceries into categories like electronics and personal care products.\\\\nThe Customer Experience: A New Era of Convenience\\\\nFor consumers, Zepto represents a significant shift in how we shop for groceries. Gone are the days of planning ahead or making multiple trips to the store. With just a few taps on their smartphones, customers can have their essentials delivered within minutes.\\\\nThis convenience is particularly appealing in urban areas where traffic congestion can make traditional grocery shopping a hassle. By leveraging data analytics to understand consumer behavior, Zepto tailors its offerings to meet local demands‚Äîensuring that items popular in specific neighborhoods are readily available.\\\\nReal Calculations: The Impact of Dark Stores on Delivery Times\\\\nTo illustrate the efficiency of Zepto‚Äôs model with some real calculations:\\\\n- Average Delivery Distance: 1.8 km\\\\n- Average Delivery Time: 8 minutes 47 seconds\\\\n- Time Taken for Picking & Packing: 58 seconds\\\\nIf we break down the average delivery time:\\\\nAssuming an average speed of 15 km/h (which is reasonable for urban deliveries), it takes approximately:\\\\nDelivery Time = Distance/ Speed = 1.8 km/ 15 km h ‚âà 7.2 minutes\\\\nAdding picking and packing time:\\\\nTotal Time = 7.2 minutes + 0.97 minutes ‚âà 8.17 minutes\\\\nThis calculation aligns closely with their reported average delivery time of 8 minutes and 47 seconds, showcasing how efficiently they operate.\\\\nFuture Prospects: What Lies Ahead for Zepto?\\\\nAs I reflect on Zepto‚Äôs journey so far, it‚Äôs clear that they are not just another player in the grocery delivery space; they are setting new standards for what consumers can expect from quick commerce.\\\\nWith plans for further expansion and continuous optimization of its operations, Zepto aims to solidify its position as a leader in ultra-fast deliveries.\\\\nThere‚Äôs also talk of consolidation within the industry as competitors struggle with cash burn rates during this growth phase. However, as consumer demand for quick deliveries continues to rise, companies like Zepto may find themselves at an advantage due to their established infrastructure and brand recognition.\\\\nConclusion: A Revolution in Grocery Delivery\\\\nIn conclusion, Zepto‚Äôs dark store revolution exemplifies how innovation can reshape an industry. By focusing on operational efficiency, strategic location planning, and leveraging technology, they have created a compelling value proposition for consumers seeking convenience.\\\\nAs we move forward into an era where time is increasingly precious, companies like Zepto will likely continue to thrive‚Äîpushing boundaries and setting benchmarks that redefine our shopping experiences.\\\\nSo next time you find yourself waiting for your groceries to arrive at your doorstep within minutes‚Äîremember that behind this magic lies a meticulously crafted system designed to cater to your every need!\\\\n                \\\\n                None\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto Marketing Strategy ‚Äì Everything About the 10-Minutes Grocery Delivery App\\\\nIn the present era of technical advancement, every sector is evolving and going through a renaissance. Therefore, how can the delivery sector lag? The delivery sector is going through a lot of changes every day. Different delivery apps and startups are bringing in other methods.\\\\nIn this blog today, we will discuss the marketing strategy of Zepto ‚Äì one of the most prominent grocery delivery apps of the present time. The best part of Zepto marketing strategy is the 10-minute guarantee delivery. As a result, you can get groceries delivered to your doorstep that you previously purchased from the local general store.\\\\nWhat is Zepto? What Types of Companies Comes Under the Zepto Marketing Strategy?\\\\nZepto offers service only through the official application. At present, it has more than 80 dark stores throughout the country. These stores are primarily in tier one cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, and more. Zepto is a pan-India company that started its operations in April 2021. However, it was founded in September 2020.\\\\nThe primary reason Zepto has a successful business model in India is that Zepto marketing strategy includes producing 2500+ goods within 10 minutes. As a result, it was impossible for any top delivery or e-commerce sites.\\\\nWhether it is the marketing strategy of Zepto or any other marketing strategy, there are a lot of crucial factors. The idea is one of the most important ones of them. The Story of Zepto starts when the two founders, who were studying computer science, got tempted with their creative idea to start a business.\\\\nWith the idea to deliver food to your doorsteps in the least possible time, Zepto was introduced. The most crucial thing was that Zepto was introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the strict lockdown, when people were striving hard to get out of their homes, the founders worked hard to make the delivery possible even during the restrictions.\\\\nHow does Zepto Delivery Work? A Detail on Zepto Business Model\\\\nThe Zepto business model was inspired by the idea on which KiranaKart depends. KiranaKart depends on is for the local shopkeepers and managers. They deliver the goods and products within 45 minutes of placing the order. Zepto marketing strategy is based on similar ideas. Both the founders were bachelors, and they had to struggle a lot to get food delivered. This is where they got the idea of creating such an app that quickly provides grocery items.\\\\nAlso Read: 8 Compelling Reasons to Invest in a Grocery App Development Company\\\\nTheir vision is to open Zepto Dark stores all over India and expand the brand at the top level. They are planning to increase the team from 400 to 800 by 2023. You must think that Zepto app is the only company to be the fastest delivery online shopping app. At the same time, they are facing intense competition from rival companies like Swiggy, Zomato, Blinkit and Dunzo. The best part is all the competitors are offering the same service at equal rates.\\\\nTherefore, it was not easy to stay in the top place. Zepto marketing strategy required more business skills and investment to be the fastest delivery app in India. They introduced new standards to transform their work in the delivery infrastructure ‚Äì right from the basic level. In simple words, ground-level work was still needed.\\\\nFunding & Investment for Zepto Marketing Strategy\\\\nThe leading sources for Zepto‚Äôs funds are Y combinator community funds and Glade brook capital partners. Both invested 100 million dollars and 4.4 billion rupees, respectively. Zepto has a successful business model in India, showing continuous growth. You can see the Zepto marketing strategy‚Äôs success from the number of stores they have opened across cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune and more.\\\\nAs the fastest delivery app in India, Zepto delivers grocery items only in the stores‚Äô available areas. The technical office is in Bangalore. This is where all the technicalities are handled, while the operations are done from the Mumbai office. So, if you ask if the supermarket business is profitable in India, we will say YES. Why? Popular apps like Flipkart, Uber, Dream11 and more have their key executives in the Zepto app. Recently, Lazypay and Pescafresh partnered with Zepto.\\\\nZepto Talent Acquisition\\\\nAnother important thing that has worked in favour of a successful Zepto marketing strategy is acquiring talent. Top executives decided to join Zepto because it allowed so many people that had shifted to Bangalore to come back to Mumbai. However, the fast growth of the start-up, its ambition and the disciplined execution encouraged several people to be attracted to the company.\\\\nOrder Volume Claims\\\\nBlinkit & Instamart claimed that their weekly order volume increased to more than a million. So, the question is, what about Zepto? How many orders are they delivering now? Well, Zepto is not too keen to publish the numbers. However, they are saying that with the current numbers, they shall easily surpass the competitors in the market.\\\\nZepto Business Model: Dark Store Model\\\\nDark stores might seem a sinister option, but it is a great idea that helped multiple retail businesses stay afloat throughout the pandemic. The dark stores are distribution outlets that are not open to visitors. These are micro warehouses that quickly and accurately fulfil orders. Therefore, they offer shoppers resources and options like buying products online, pickup in-store and same-day delivery.\\\\nAccording to the founders and shareholders of the Zepto app, the magic of the dark store model is how they became the fastest delivery app in India. With the help of the dark stores, they could pick, pack, and dispatch the goods within 60 seconds. However, the last section is just like any other delivery model.\\\\nSuch a grocery delivery model is implemented in developed nations; however, the model was never explored in India. The dark store model reduces the trivial challenges that any delivery service faces. These include navigation, traffic congestion, and connectivity.\\\\nZepto marketing strategy used geography, location intelligence, population, road patterns, traffic dynamics, last-minute supply availability, weather, real estate values and others. All these factors improved the network‚Äôs overall performance.\\\\nDark stores are meant for instant deliveries and can‚Äôt handle the sales volume. However, the Zepto grocery app didn‚Äôt compromise on the shortcomings of this model. They have thousands of products on display, fresh produce, meat, milk, kitchen refills and more at the best bargain. Also, the AI-powered tool ensures a smooth transition, right from picking, packing, and delivering. All these features make the Zepto grocery app the fastest online shopping app.\\\\nBenefits of Zepto Business Model\\\\nThere are a lot of benefits to the Zepto Business Model. In the following section of the blog, we shall mention a few.\\\\n1. Better Distribution & Faster Delivery\\\\nThe dark store enables Zepto to fulfill orders quickly and more efficiently. In addition, the micro and cold warehouses offer several distribution choices and bring groceries closer to a particular market segment. Thus, you can see that Zepto has higher control over the market spread and distribution. It is another reason why Zepto is the fastest delivery app in India.\\\\n2. Better and Broader Customer Reach\\\\nOne of the dark stores‚Äô most important features is bringing the distribution centres close to the consumers. The best thing about these stores is they are always online to take orders. It is what brings consumers to such platforms and uses their services. Therefore, it is one of the essential features that made the successful Zepto marketing strategy.\\\\n3. Contactless Shopping\\\\nThere is no denying the fact that the need for contact-free shopping is a critical factor for businesses to adopt the ‚Äúdark store‚Äù approach. The dark stores allow consumers to purchase groceries in a contactless way without entering a physical store. All you must do is place orders, and you will get them instantly.\\\\n4. Better Inventory Control and Product Assortment\\\\nZepto‚Äôs business model and Zepto marketing strategy worked because they chose dark stores. The dark stores are customer-free zones, and they have better control over the inventory. Therefore, they can easily manage larger order volumes. In addition, the dark stores are designed to ensure easy navigation, allowing the packers to move quickly to pack the items in an order. Also, the AI-powered tools keep the inventory stock track and provide product assortment.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs USP\\\\nZepto‚Äôs business model is customer-centric, and it is an instant delivery model. However, Zepto offers a few selling points that set it apart from its competitors. Still, these are also included in the model.\\\\nOne of the main reasons the Zepto app is the fastest online shopping app is because Zepto has instant delivery and is regarded as quick commerce. They are capable enough to fulfill the grocery delivery in 10 minutes. Also, they claim to have a delivery time of 8 minutes and 47 seconds.\\\\nAccording to the founders, when a user checks the order, it is already shipped out for delivery. Therefore, it is another essential element that makes Zepto marketing strategy successful. They fulfill almost every order within 10 minutes. Only one percent of the charges might take 15-16 minutes.\\\\nAnother crucial factor for successful business models in India is to offer free shipping. Zepto offers free shipping. Even though this USP has got dim compared to the former one, it still doesn‚Äôt charge a delivery fee. On the other hand, Amazon Fresh & Instacart have delivery fees.\\\\nYou must remember that the free service doesn‚Äôt mean costlier products. Yet another USP is that it offers excellent discounts on its list of products and groceries.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs Online Ad Campaigns\\\\nZepto marketing campaigns are one of the best ones you shall see in the ad campaigns of recent companies. Zepto witnessed growth primarily because of its unique ad campaigns online. All of this they achieved in a short time. Did you know? L&K Saatchi & Saatchi was behind 3 of Zepto‚Äôs recent ads.\\\\nThe idea behind all Zepto‚Äôs ad campaigns is that time is an expandable commodity in India. Therefore, you cannot afford to waste it. Whether you must board a flight or wait for the food at a restaurant, we all have experienced stretchable time. It is where Zepto ad campaigns have stood apart.\\\\nHere are examples of the Zepto marketing strategy ad campaign where they surprisingly used three famous singers. Usha Uthup, Shankar Mahadevan & Kailash Kher are cast in unusual roles where they must stretch time in their way ‚Äì thus highlighting the objective of Zepto, which is on-time delivery.\\\\nThe ad campaigns have paved the way for the Zepto app to be the most talked about brand.\\\\nHere‚Äôs What Zepto‚Äôs Chief Marketing Officer has to Say\\\\nAmritansu Nanda, Chief Marketing Officer of Zepto, says, ‚ÄúOur consumers lead busy, fast-paced lives. At Zepto, through our on-time delivery promise and at the back of our exceptional tech, we constantly strive to let them know and reassure them that we value their time. This campaign, featuring some of the most iconic pop-culture voices of the country, brings alive our proposition of quick delivery and strikes the right chord with our core TG through relatable entertainment. It is also a critical milestone in our journey towards becoming synonymous with quick-commerce in India.‚Äù\\\\nKartik Smetacek, Jt NCD, L&K Saatchi, and Saatchi added, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs often said clients get the work they deserve. Zepto is a case in point. From scripting these to presenting them to producing them, working on the campaign was an absolute pleasure, with the agency and client working as one team completely committed to the product. I think the results speak for themselves.\\\\nIn Conclusion\\\\nZepto marketing strategy has helped the brand to grow as the fastest delivery app in India. Zepto app has plans to expand into newer cities as quickly as possible. They are also planning to increase their coverage to micro-markets and be the leaders in the sector. Several other competitors are trying to participate in the market and grow quickly. However, they cannot promise things like 10-minute delivery consistently. Zepto is a detail-oriented and intense business with technical and operating discipline that allows them to ensure the 10-minute delivery.\\\\nShyam Future Tech LLP ‚Äì the ISO 27001:2013 & 9001:2015 certified IT venture of Shyam Steel Industries Ltd., digitally empowers all sorts of businesses of every scale.

Zepto is growing at a 200% rise in price in 11 months, with 60% repeat customers.\\\\nIn April 2021, two friends, Kaivalya Vohra [CTO] and Aadit Palicha [CEO], both 19, formed Zepto. They were both admitted to Stanford University and were scheduled to acquire a Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Computer Science, but instead opted to construct Zepto. Earlier in September 2020, they started ‚ÄúKirana Mart‚Äù which was a supermart delivery startup similar to Big Basket and Grofers. However, until January 2021, it was well known as Zepto.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs Shareholdings ‚Äì\\\\nZepto is backed by nine investors. Major shareholders of Zepto are Kaivalya Vohra (18.8%), Aadit Palicha (22.5%), Nexus Ventures (20.7%), eBooks Private Investors (10.4%), Y Combinator (5.1%), Rocket Internet (5.7%) and others(16.8%). The most recent investors are Contrary and Glade Brook Capital Partners. The firm is currently valued at $900 million, and it has raised a total of $200 million.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs funding ‚Äì\\\\nThe company has recently raised $200 million at a current valuation of $900 million in its Series D round led by Y Combinator Continuity with Kaser Permanente along with other existing investors like Nexus Venture Partners, Glade Brook Capital and Lachy Room. Although, it was looking forward to a valuation of $1 billion to attain the unicorn status it didn‚Äôt come through. Earlier in December 2021, it had raised $100 mn led by YC Continuity at a valuation of $570 million.\\\\nIt plans to utilise the fresh funds to grow operations, recruit more employees, improve goods, and develop its recently established ‚ÄòZepto Cafe‚Äô service. To serve snackable goods in 10 minutes, the Mumbai-based firm has partnered with establishments such as Blue Tokai Coffee, Chaayos, Gurukripa snacks, and Sassy Teaspoon. Tea, pastries, samosas, and coffee are among the goodies being offered.\\\\nAcquiring fresh talent ‚Äì\\\\nThe talent acquisition department was one of the primary things that went correctly for the firm. They were successful in attracting numerous high-level executives from Amazon. Uber, Pharmeasy, Flipkart, and Dream 11 have all expressed interest in joining their group.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs 10 Minute Delivery ‚Äì\\\\nZepto introduced its notion of 10-minute delivery. The entire sport and situation were altered. Customers were agitated, but they couldn‚Äôt do much because of the loss of many possibilities in the market. People‚Äôs impatience was exploited by Zepto with its 10min delivery value proposition.\\\\nHow does Zepto manage to deliver in 10 minutes?\\\\nThis takes us closer to Zepto‚Äôs second method, ‚ÄúThe dark shop model.‚Äù Dark shops are basically mini-warehouses with the capacity to service all clients within a 3-kilometre radius. Zepto employs a one-of-a-kind product called Locus. This solution tracks the customer‚Äôs geostatistical data, traffic dynamics, and how long it will take for the last mile delivery. As a result, it chose whether or not to build a new Dark Store in that area.\\\\nLocus is an AI application that leverages the Google API and presents all relevant data on the Zepto dashboard. As a result, it is not the efficiency of the delivery guys that is important, but rather the technology.\\\\nThe PPB formula is another notable Zepto approach, and it is responsible for the Dark Store model‚Äôs success.\\\\n1) Picking- It is a quick process in all Zepto stores. All employees in their dark stores have tablets, and when an order is placed, it goes to a central hub, from there it goes to the dark store, and from there it‚Äôs given to employees because everything is reflected on their tablets, that what items are in this order and which item is placed on which place, which shelf.\\\\n2) Packing ‚Äì All the items are collected and then packed quickly.\\\\n3) Bagging ‚Äì As soon as the delivery agent receives the order, the agent must exit the warehouse. Zepto requires a 60-second advance time in all three procedures of choosing, packaging, and bagging.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs Dark Store Business Model ‚Äì\\\\nDark storefronts may appear sinister, but they were one of the many brilliant ideas that have helped some retail enterprises survive the plague. Dark shops are distribution centres that are not available to the public. These mini-warehouses handle orders fast and accurately, providing customers with tools and alternatives such as purchasing items online, same-day delivery, or in-store pickup.\\\\nAccording to the founders, the secret of the dark store concept is how they choose, pack, and ship products in under 60 seconds. The last mile, on the other hand, is similar to any other delivery scheme.\\\\nDark stores are designed for quick deliveries and cannot handle high sales volumes. However, Zepto refused to accept this model‚Äôs flaws. They offer over a thousand things on display, including fresh vegetables, milk, meat, household supplies, and much more at the greatest prices. Moreover, their AI-powered tools ensure a smooth transition from picking, packing, and delivering.\\\\nExisting market participants such as Swiggy and Bigbasket could simply replicate all of these characteristics. So, how will Zepto compete with these massive corporations?\\\\nThe answer to this is concealed in Zepto‚Äôs massive tactic known as ‚ÄúHyper Focus.‚Äù\\\\nSwiggy, Big Basket, and Grofers all compete on pricing, which is something they all have in common. Customers want to place their orders where they may obtain the best discounts. But Zepto is obsessed with speed. Zepto‚Äôs client acquisition approach differs from those of these organisations.\\\\nChallenges for Zepto ‚Äì\\\\n1) Retainers ‚Äì Acquiring and retaining customers becomes more difficult for Zepto as a result of the bulk of these organisations already having significant retainers.\\\\n2) Price Power Maintenance ‚Äì Quick deliveries are very expensive, especially if delivery fees are not charged. Running low prices and speed at the same time is much more difficult, and to do so requires a lot of cash flow and funding.\\\\n3) Income economies -The third thread is ‚ÄúEconomies of scale.‚Äù Because the daily earnings of Swiggy, Big Basket, and Grofers are likely to be quite substantial, they will have additional cash compared to Zepto, and they have also been provided investment.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs Future Goals ‚Äì\\\\nIn the future, Zepto intends to grow the number of Dark Stores in order to boost the number of orders. Once they start retaining clients, they want to start collecting convenience fees. Though Zepto may face severe dangers in the near future owing to fierce rivalry, it‚Äôs incredible how two 19-year-old lads leap and shake the roots of massive corporations such as Big Basket or Blinkit, among others. It might also announce its public listing incoming 2-3 years.\\\\nConclusion ‚Äì\\\\nToday‚Äôs consumer is more concerned with the cost supplied by using the brand rather than the logo itself. Because the consumer is loyal to the price supplied by the brand rather than the logo itself, continually improving the pricing proposition is the only option left for firms to survive in the market.\\\\nSomething is generally left unexplored in every marketplace, area, and enterprise. If we look at this circumstance, we can see that there was an untapped demand of people‚Äôs impatience by making use of what Zepto has established across the entire organisation.\\\\n                \\\\n                During the pandemic time, online grocery delivery got immense popularity. The main operator of the online grocery delivery apps and business is changing customer behavior.\\\\nThese days, customers are likely to purchase online. This has resulted in alluring more delivery businesses like Zepto to start their delivery service and serve customers‚Äô growing needs with the fastest delivery. If you are searching to dive into the market, then you must know about the Zepto business model and it will be helpful for you.\\\\nIn terms of financial commitments, involvement, and attention, the grocery delivery business is growing.

We\\\\\\'ve got Zulzi in Africa vying for the moon.\\\\n                \\\\n                ZEPTO ‚Äî In depth Case Study\\\\nAs a Product Leader, I have come up with an Interesting, Insightful, In depth Business Case Study of ZEPTO and also sharing my experience after making couple of orders just to explore the quality of their Product delivery, overall customer experience, UI/UX part, Business challenges and most importantly the ‚ÄúTime bound delivery ‚Äî 10 Min‚Äù they claim it as a disruptive business model. Here you can find the document attached.\\\\nWith 10 ‚Äî Min grocery delivery becoming new normal, Dark stores are defined as Lifeblood of this startup. Let‚Äôs deep dive into this interesting business model, strategy, Key elements that drives this business, their own challenges, my own personal experience with Zepto services and finally a conclusion.\\\\nWhat does ‚ÄúZepto‚Äù denotes ?\\\\nZepto (unit symbol z) is a unit prefix in the metric system denoting a factor of 10‚àí21, i.e. 0.000000000000000000001 Zeptosecond.\\\\nFounders and their Business Model\\\\nZepto business model was developed by Aadit Palicha (Founder-CEO) and Kaivalya Vohra (Founder & CTO) who were both 19 at the time when they were university drop out. Zepto unique business model promises to deliver the grocery in 10 minutes and this may go upto 20 but the time is being informed to customer as soon as they do add to cart and even before making the order Zepto usually does not put a limit on the number of products a user can order. But the delivery time increases depending on order size and the distance between the delivery location and their dark stores also based on the traffic, rain and other climatic conditions.\\\\nThe company began its operations in Mumbai in 2021 and extended its operations to Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Pune, Noida, Kolkata, Ghaziabad. They are operating the Delivery from 7 AM ‚Äî 1 AM. The business of online grocery delivery is already taking off in India with a $1 trillion retail market perceived and expected to grow at very fast rate.\\\\nMy Personal Review\\\\nBefore we deep dive into their Business model, strategy, challenges etc., Let me share my personal experience of ordering groceries in Zepto app from Chennai. Just to share my own experience in terms of Quality of products, Delivery speed, customer support etc. I ordered items for total Rs.520 to get additional discount.\\\\nHere I noticed some of key aspects that makes Zepto a true differentiator from its competitors in the segment.\\\\n¬∑ Timer clock starts immediately after placing the order in the app and order gets delivered within the committed time with proper packaging. This excites the customer which is completely a new experience for us in India.\\\\n¬∑ Mobile App UI/UX was so user friendly and appealing to use and play around. There are few micro level enhancements is needed but it‚Äôs no more a showstopper for a normal user.\\\\n¬∑ In order to make this delivery within very short time, entire Supply chain process is optimized, well planned in such a way all Groceries were packed in different weights according to the listing of product in app even before getting the orders and placed in the well designated bins in dark stores.\\\\nSo, it‚Äôs very easy for person to go to these bins as per the received order -> Handed over to Billing section ‚Äî Billed -> Handed over to the Last mile Delivery person.\\\\n¬∑ Prices of almost all the listed items were reasonable, in fact price was less than the brick-and-mortar shops without any additional delivery charges if minimum total value is above 100 INR and special discounts applicable if total value 500 INR. This subsequently results in increase of total sales and profits end of day.\\\\n¬∑ Interesting to notice, Fruits that are costly in general were listed in Pieces instead of 500 gms / 1 Kg. Customers has no clue to think and compare this price by converting price per Kg, it‚Äôs very hard to do it while ordering. Pricing team did a smart job here. At same time, customers wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to buy one piece of Dragon fruit for Rs.99 instead of getting surprised to see Rs.300 /500 grams and there is higher possibility that they may not add to cart and move forward leaving this item.\\\\nExample: Apple, Pomegranate, Dragon fruits were listed in pieces. Dragon fruit ‚Äî Rs.99/Piece etc. When we see price per piece looks cheap or reasonable over seeing per kg which would normally be Rs.400-Rs.600 above. It‚Äôs human nature.\\\\n¬∑ I want to mention the amazing experience from customer support team of Zepto. I tried reaching them via Online chat & On call support on 28th March 2022. I was able to reach the team within less than a minute. Later I came to know the team operates from 7 am ‚Äî 2 am IST and they were able to help us with the query with great sense of patience and customer friendly nature. Kudos to the entire team.\\\\nScope for Improvement:\\\\n¬∑ As of now Zepto doesn‚Äôt have option to pay via Sodexo vouchers which is a highly needed as most of millennials do have this vouchers to save tax. This is not a big deal for Zepto to incorporate. Hope they will add it very soon.\\\\n¬∑ Can give option to customers to choose their comfortable time slots for Delivery. This will let the customers who want to place orders in advance and want to make the delivery time of their choice. As of now users are forced to get the delivery immediately in 10‚Äì20 minutes irrespective of their own choice of time.\\\\nWhat are the possible levers that drives the business growth of Zepto further?\\\\n¬∑ Huge young population in India with deep penetration of smart phones with Internet access.\\\\n¬∑ Rise in the earning population\\\\n¬∑ Millennials no more want to prefer brick and mortar shops for buying Groceries, Veg, fruits to save their time, money, fuel etc.\\\\nScalability\\\\nHere I have added my personal view where I see there is huge scope for scaling the business in India.\\\\n¬∑ Expanding to Tier 2, Tier 3 cities in India.\\\\n¬∑ Expanding to other geographies ‚Äî fast growing economies and under penetrated countries.\\\\n¬∑ Expanding product portfolio not limited to only Groceries. There is ample scope to add new segments like Medicines, 100% organic Vegetables/Fruits/Provisions etc to pull more crowd.\\\\n¬∑ More scope to add few more thousands of product catalogs in the app which will happen gradually.\\\\nChallenges\\\\nStrong competitors for Zepto are Flipkart (Backed by Walmart), Amazon, Blinkit-formerly Grofers (Backed by softbank group), Dunzo (Backed by Google), Swiggy (Backed by Naspers Limited) etc. These competitors will definitely try to copy this 10 minute delivery model across their grocery segments. We need to wait and watch the next move of these large corporates where their warehouse and entire supply chain process already got established in the market.\\\\nConclusion:\\\\nIt‚Äôs undoubtedly, Zepto is a providing ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù services to the end customers, growing faster than anyone else in this niche model at the moment with proven 10 minutes delivery model with a well-established, advanced Supply chain process leveraging A.I and various algorithms in place.\\\\nThey were able to afford, attract great leadership team from their competitors like Amazon, Flipkart, Walmart etc which laid amazing foundation for a startup like Zepto.\\\\nMany players in the market are pushed to try this 10 min delivery but it‚Äôs not so easy to consistently honor this promise every time. Where Dunzo normally takes 20- 30 minutes for the same delivery but even though they don‚Äôt claim to be time bound. It needs lot of high level ground work, Advanced Planning and Supply chain process, Micro level dark stores established every 3‚Äì4 km.\\\\nIt‚Äôs needless to say, if it‚Äôs possible for Zepto it‚Äôs also possible for other large giants to implement if they have concrete clear vision, strategy, time and investment. Zepto is a detail-oriented and intense business with strong technical and operating discipline that allows them to successfully establish the model of 10-minute delivery.\\\\nFinally, I‚Äôm ending with this statement, ‚ÄúZepto ‚Äî A Unicorn in the making!!‚Äù Way to go ‚Ä¶\\\\nThanks for taking your valuable time to go through my Case study on this product ‚Äî ‚ÄúZEPTO‚Äù. I would be glad to know your valuable feedback and comments and help me to enhance the content in future. Take care.\\\\nPlease feel free to reach me on Mail: rrkatheer@gmail.com\\\\nFollow me on L.I for more updates: https://www.linkedin.com/in/katheeravanrajan/\\\\n                \\\\n                Introduction\\\\nZepto is a quickly-growing grocery delivery platform in India. It promises to deliver groceries to your doorsteps within 10 minutes. Other companies offer delivery within 30 minutes. But Zepto delivers the daily essentials within 10 minutes. The business model of Zepto involves its business plan, revenue model, competitors, SWOT Analysis, and many more.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs business model was developed by a couple of successful instant grocery delivery startup founders. The company was founded by two teenagers Aadit Palecha and his childhood buddy Kaivalya Vohra. The Zepto business model works within the quick commerce segment in India.\\\\nBusiness Plan\\\\nThe Zepto business model promises to deliver your grocery in 10 minutes. Zepto‚Äôs network of ‚Äúcloud shops‚Äù or ‚Äúmicro-warehouses‚Äù allows the company to fill orders quickly and efficiently. Zepto business model is based on the ‚Äúdark store model.‚Äù This involves setting up warehouse-style stores in residential areas that are only accessible to delivery drivers. The stores contain a range of products, and customers can only order via the Zepto India app or website. Zepto currently has over 86+ dark stores in various locations. While dark stores are designed for instant deliveries, they can‚Äôt always handle high sales volume.\\\\nZepto has places called dark stores or micro fulfillment centers that lie in higher-demand neighborhoods. These dark stores use technology for performing tasks such as the placement of products. Some other tasks they perform include deciding the store locations, and mapping delivery routes for avoiding heavy traffic congestions. The company is already delivering items that include cooking necessities, fresh produce, personal care items, snacks and beverages, and home cleaning items.\\\\n- Faster delivery and enhanced distribution\\\\n- Raise customer reach\\\\n- Contactless shopping\\\\n- Enhanced Product Assortment and Inventory\\\\nThese facilities, which allow the company to fulfill its ten-minute promise on up to 90% of orders, possess the following characteristics:\\\\n- They are not open to the public.\\\\n- They are located in high-demand neighborhoods.\\\\n- They stock only the most commonly ordered items.\\\\n- They are ergonomically designed to ensure order packers can move as swiftly and efficiently as possible.\\\\nRevenue Model\\\\nZepto makes money by charging a commission fee from the grocery stores for every order placed through the app. Additionally, Zepto may charge a delivery fee from the customers for the delivery service.\\\\nMargins on each individual product\\\\nHandling Charges\\\\nProduct Customizations\\\\nProduct Ads\\\\nMembership\\\\nBy subscribing to their membership, you can get\\\\n- Free deliveries on all orders\\\\n- No surge fees\\\\n- Better discounts\\\\nCompetitors\\\\nSWOT Analysis\\\\nStrengths\\\\n‚Ä¢ Excellent usage of technology: With the assistance of www.locus.sh Zepto records its customers‚Äô geographical data, traffic dynamics, delivery time, and so on. They gather and evaluate this data to determine whether more dark establishments are needed in the region to meet the 10-minute objective.\\\\n‚Ä¢ Competent Workforce: The effective management of Zepto is in the hands of highly skilled and experienced professionals. They are Zepto‚Äô s most valuable resource since they are well informed about the market. Palicha and Vohra, the co-founders, did a fantastic job in creating their team.\\\\n‚Ä¢ Strong financial support: Zepto is well-funded, which allows it to expand and grow into a market leader. They currently have a total funding of $360 million.\\\\n‚Ä¢ Being true to their objective: Zepto ensures that their customers‚Äô expectations are met by delivering goods in 10 minutes. Zepto achieves their aim 90% of the time, which contributes to brand loyalty.\\\\nWeakness\\\\n‚Ä¢ Net Income: Zepto‚Äôs operational costs are high. They need to grow their sales while decreasing some of their expenditures to make their business profitable.\\\\n‚Ä¢ Reliance on retailers: Zepto‚Äôs business strategy is primarily dependent on other businesses and their inventory. When a retailer‚Äôs stock is unavailable, customers may be forced to select a higher-priced substitution or go without buying that item from them.\\\\n‚Ä¢ Nothing Unique: Zepto‚Äôs business strategy is not very unique, and any company may enter this market and replicate it.\\\\n‚Ä¢ Fluctuating customer base: To keep their clientele, Zepto must find a balance between their discount strategy and keeping their delivery time under 10 minutes.\\\\nOpportunity\\\\n‚Ä¢ Infiltrating further into existing locations and entering fresh cities: One way they can outperform their competitors is to grow their business as quickly as possible.\\\\n‚Ä¢ Various Business Ventures: Zepto has developed a brand identity for itself, which they can now utilize to enter into other sectors and diversify their revenue stream.\\\\nThreats\\\\n- Heavy competition: Zepto is in a league with big names. Customers swing from one app to the next like a pendulum. Because there is little consumer loyalty, Zepto must continually stay on top of their game.\\\\n- Exploitation of delivery boys: There are several sceptics of the quick commerce industry. Delivery boys are exploited in the name of quick delivery and are subjected to extreme strain, increasing the likelihood of an accident.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nZepto is a detail-oriented and intense business with strong technical and operating discipline that allows them to pull off the 10-minute delivery. Zepto is looking to offer its service to more countries. This company is planning to cover about 100 pin codes. The fastest delivery is a fresh idea. The delivery platform brings fast delivery to customers through the dark store concept.\\\\n                \\\\n                WHEN CHILDHOOD FRIENDS Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra first dabbled in hyperlocal delivery by launching Kiranakart in August 2020, the opportunity clearly was to solve for the hundreds of families in their neighbourhood in Mumbai‚Äôs Andheri [East] who were stuck in their homes. It was the Covid-19 lockdown and consumers were more than willing to pay a premium to get basics delivered to their doorstep. The duo took orders on a WhatsApp group and personally delivered ‚Äî milk, groceries, and even meat ‚Äî on bikes within 40-45 minutes. A few months later, when they started expanding to the adjoining localities of Juhu and Bandra, they built the Kiranakart app and tied up with local retailers to source the goods.\\\\nHowever, within a year, consumer preferences changed. The lockdown ended, and consumers were back to shopping from neighbourhood stores. ‚ÄúThey wanted more consistent delivery because their options [kirana stores] were just 300 metres down the road,‚Äù says Palicha. Their customers told the duo that they were using them because of the pandemic, ‚Äúand if we didn‚Äôt deliver at speed, offer a wider selection, and not keep quality [under] control, they wouldn‚Äôt use us,‚Äù he recalls.\\\\nThis led to the birth of Zepto, where Palicha is now co-founder & CEO, in July 2021. It promised to deliver in 10 minutes ‚Äî and to do that, the Zepto boys [both 19 then] decided to go the ‚Äòdark stores‚Äô way. They set up micro-warehouses in every locality from where orders were delivered to consumers‚Äô homes; and instead of picking up orders from local retailers, they invested in a robust supply chain for groceries, vegetables, and meat.\\\\nThe promise of delivering in 10 minutes generated a lot of excitement, but the market was sceptical; and it had reasons to be so. Global e-commerce giants had burnt their fingers with this model ‚Äî profits were nowhere in sight and several smaller players had even gone bankrupt. The critics were of the view that there was no way a 10-minute delivery model would work, even in the medium term. But the Zepto boys have proved even the harshest of critics wrong, with the company claiming that it had done business close to ‚Çπ10,000 crore in calendar year 2024; in FY23, the number was ‚Çπ2,078 crore.\\\\n‚ÄúThere is a prototype,‚Äù says Angshuman Bhattacharya, national leader, consumer products and retail sector, EY. ‚ÄúIf it is a matured city like Mumbai, it is making money. Then there is an expansion and investment part of the business when you enter a new city. The P&L may still bleed because there is rapid expansion happening, but in larger cities, the network productivity is higher than foodtech.‚Äù\\\\nZepto is close to breaking even in terms of Ebitda, says Palicha. Today, it has more than 700 dark stores and over 15,000 stock-keeping units [SKUs], with the average order value being close to ‚Çπ600. Quick commerce, a $2.8-billion industry, has become an integral part of any consumer goods company‚Äôs distribution strategy. And brands are innovating especially for quick commerce platforms.\\\\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about 10-minute delivery. People in India like high-frequency, low-stakes purchases. Most consumption in India has a frequency of two-three times a week, unlike in the U.S. where people buy in bulk. You need proximity to the customer for delivering three times a week. Also, deliver a [wide] selection, quality and good value proposition,‚Äù says Palicha.\\\\nZepto is now valued at $5 billion and has received more than $1.5 billion in funding so far. ‚ÄúThe name of the game is optimising every element across the supply chain. Whether it is vertical integration for better supply chain management, throughput for sq. ft management, manpower productivity, network design across dark stores, driving more ad revenue from brands or building new categories, we have done that pretty rigourously in the past two years,‚Äù says Palicha, adding that in Q1FY25, Zepto was close to Ebitda break-even at the company level [excluding ESOPs]. ‚ÄúAround 70% of our dark stores are cash-flow positive. Earlier, it took 23 months for a dark store to turn profitable; now it takes eight months,‚Äù says Palicha.\\\\nEarlier, the capital required to launch a dark store and turn it profitable was around ‚Çπ3.91 crore. That has come down to ‚Çπ1.54 crore. ‚ÄúWe reached $1 billion top-line faster than Flipkart. It took Flipkart four years. We did it in two-and-a-half years, with a fraction of the capital. It‚Äôs all about deep execution and excellence,‚Äù says Palicha.\\\\nZepto is no longer restricted to groceries, meat and vegetables. When the world was queuing up at Apple Stores to buy the latest iPhone 16, Zepto promised delivery in 10 minutes. From a fancy Manyavar kurta to a quick snack from Zepto Caf√©, the quick commerce platform is leaving no stone unturned to offer convenience to Indian consumers.\\\\n                \\\\n                \\')], _name=None, _meta={})]}', origin=ToolCall(tool_name='webSearch', arguments={'query': 'Zepto business strategy'}, id=None), error=False)], _name=None, _meta={}),\n",

Here you can find the document attached.\\\\nWith 10 ‚Äî Min grocery delivery becoming new normal, Dark stores are defined as Lifeblood of this startup. Let‚Äôs deep dive into this interesting business model, strategy, Key elements that drives this business, their own challenges, my own personal experience with Zepto services and finally a conclusion.\\\\nWhat does ‚ÄúZepto‚Äù denotes ?\\\\nZepto (unit symbol z) is a unit prefix in the metric system denoting a factor of 10‚àí21, i.e. 0.000000000000000000001 Zeptosecond.\\\\nFounders and their Business Model\\\\nZepto business model was developed by Aadit Palicha (Founder-CEO) and Kaivalya Vohra (Founder & CTO) who were both 19 at the time when they were university drop out. Zepto unique business model promises to deliver the grocery in 10 minutes and this may go upto 20 but the time is being informed to customer as soon as they do add to cart and even before making the order Zepto usually does not put a limit on the number of products a user can order. But the delivery time increases depending on order size and the distance between the delivery location and their dark stores also based on the traffic, rain and other climatic conditions.\\\\nThe company began its operations in Mumbai in 2021 and extended its operations to Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Pune, Noida, Kolkata, Ghaziabad. They are operating the Delivery from 7 AM ‚Äî 1 AM. The business of online grocery delivery is already taking off in India with a $1 trillion retail market perceived and expected to grow at very fast rate.\\\\nMy Personal Review\\\\nBefore we deep dive into their Business model, strategy, challenges etc., Let me share my personal experience of ordering groceries in Zepto app from Chennai. Just to share my own experience in terms of Quality of products, Delivery speed, customer support etc. I ordered items for total Rs.520 to get additional discount.\\\\nHere I noticed some of key aspects that makes Zepto a true differentiator from its competitors in the segment.\\\\n¬∑ Timer clock starts immediately after placing the order in the app and order gets delivered within the committed time with proper packaging. This excites the customer which is completely a new experience for us in India.\\\\n¬∑ Mobile App UI/UX was so user friendly and appealing to use and play around. There are few micro level enhancements is needed but it‚Äôs no more a showstopper for a normal user.\\\\n¬∑ In order to make this delivery within very short time, entire Supply chain process is optimized, well planned in such a way all Groceries were packed in different weights according to the listing of product in app even before getting the orders and placed in the well designated bins in dark stores.\\\\nSo, it‚Äôs very easy for person to go to these bins as per the received order -> Handed over to Billing section ‚Äî Billed -> Handed over to the Last mile Delivery person.\\\\n¬∑ Prices of almost all the listed items were reasonable, in fact price was less than the brick-and-mortar shops without any additional delivery charges if minimum total value is above 100 INR and special discounts applicable if total value 500 INR. This subsequently results in increase of total sales and profits end of day.\\\\n¬∑ Interesting to notice, Fruits that are costly in general were listed in Pieces instead of 500 gms / 1 Kg. Customers has no clue to think and compare this price by converting price per Kg, it‚Äôs very hard to do it while ordering. Pricing team did a smart job here. At same time, customers wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to buy one piece of Dragon fruit for Rs.99 instead of getting surprised to see Rs.300 /500 grams and there is higher possibility that they may not add to cart and move forward leaving this item.\\\\nExample: Apple, Pomegranate, Dragon fruits were listed in pieces. Dragon fruit ‚Äî Rs.99/Piece etc. When we see price per piece looks cheap or reasonable over seeing per kg which would normally be Rs.400-Rs.600 above. It‚Äôs human nature.\\\\n¬∑ I want to mention the amazing experience from customer support team of Zepto. I tried reaching them via Online chat & On call support on 28th March 2022. I was able to reach the team within less than a minute. Later I came to know the team operates from 7 am ‚Äî 2 am IST and they were able to help us with the query with great sense of patience and customer friendly nature. Kudos to the entire team.\\\\nScope for Improvement:\\\\n¬∑ As of now Zepto doesn‚Äôt have option to pay via Sodexo vouchers which is a highly needed as most of millennials do have this vouchers to save tax. This is not a big deal for Zepto to incorporate. Hope they will add it very soon.\\\\n¬∑ Can give option to customers to choose their comfortable time slots for Delivery. This will let the customers who want to place orders in advance and want to make the delivery time of their choice. As of now users are forced to get the delivery immediately in 10‚Äì20 minutes irrespective of their own choice of time.\\\\nWhat are the possible levers that drives the business growth of Zepto further?\\\\n¬∑ Huge young population in India with deep penetration of smart phones with Internet access.\\\\n¬∑ Rise in the earning population\\\\n¬∑ Millennials no more want to prefer brick and mortar shops for buying Groceries, Veg, fruits to save their time, money, fuel etc.\\\\nScalability\\\\nHere I have added my personal view where I see there is huge scope for scaling the business in India.\\\\n¬∑ Expanding to Tier 2, Tier 3 cities in India.\\\\n¬∑ Expanding to other geographies ‚Äî fast growing economies and under penetrated countries.\\\\n¬∑ Expanding product portfolio not limited to only Groceries. There is ample scope to add new segments like Medicines, 100% organic Vegetables/Fruits/Provisions etc to pull more crowd.\\\\n¬∑ More scope to add few more thousands of product catalogs in the app which will happen gradually.\\\\nChallenges\\\\nStrong competitors for Zepto are Flipkart (Backed by Walmart), Amazon, Blinkit-formerly Grofers (Backed by softbank group), Dunzo (Backed by Google), Swiggy (Backed by Naspers Limited) etc. These competitors will definitely try to copy this 10 minute delivery model across their grocery segments. We need to wait and watch the next move of these large corporates where their warehouse and entire supply chain process already got established in the market.\\\\nConclusion:\\\\nIt‚Äôs undoubtedly, Zepto is a providing ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù services to the end customers, growing faster than anyone else in this niche model at the moment with proven 10 minutes delivery model with a well-established, advanced Supply chain process leveraging A.I and various algorithms in place.\\\\nThey were able to afford, attract great leadership team from their competitors like Amazon, Flipkart, Walmart etc which laid amazing foundation for a startup like Zepto.\\\\nMany players in the market are pushed to try this 10 min delivery but it‚Äôs not so easy to consistently honor this promise every time. Where Dunzo normally takes 20- 30 minutes for the same delivery but even though they don‚Äôt claim to be time bound. It needs lot of high level ground work, Advanced Planning and Supply chain process, Micro level dark stores established every 3‚Äì4 km.\\\\nIt‚Äôs needless to say, if it‚Äôs possible for Zepto it‚Äôs also possible for other large giants to implement if they have concrete clear vision, strategy, time and investment. Zepto is a detail-oriented and intense business with strong technical and operating discipline that allows them to successfully establish the model of 10-minute delivery.\\\\nFinally, I‚Äôm ending with this statement, ‚ÄúZepto ‚Äî A Unicorn in the making!!‚Äù Way to go ‚Ä¶\\\\nThanks for taking your valuable time to go through my Case study on this product ‚Äî ‚ÄúZEPTO‚Äù.

What is Zepto‚Äôs Business Model?\\\\nThere‚Äôs both a simple and a complex way of introducing Zepto‚Äôs Business Model.\\\\nIn simple words - You order groceries from Zepto and they deliver it to your location. They make money out of this process.\\\\nLet‚Äôs say that you have some visitors home. You want some sweets and a packet of chips to serve your guests. So you would go to Zepto, choose all the items you want to order, pay for it and get it in under 10 minutes.\\\\nBut here‚Äôs everything Zepto has to do to get those product to your home in under 10 mins ‚è¨\\\\nRent a warehouse and assemble their dark store\\\\nHire delivery executives to deliver your order\\\\nHire folks to handle all the packing, arranging & all other operational tasks inside the warehouse\\\\nHire folks to handle support when things don‚Äôt go as planned\\\\nSpeak to local suppliers to get the groceries and other supplies to their dark store\\\\nBuild an app to display all the items for the customers\\\\nSpeak to UPI aggregators, banks & other financial institutions to setup seamless payment systems for you\\\\nBuild in-house systems to communicate your order to the operational staff\\\\nBuild in-house systems to help the delivery executive pickup orders and deliver them safely\\\\n& so much more‚Ä¶.\\\\nWhatever you see on your smartphone is only possible because of a ton of moving parts that seem to be seamlessly fixed with each other. This is the very simple answer to Zepto‚Äôs Business Model ü§üüèº\\\\nTo understand the complex version of Zepto‚Äôs business model, you can jump to the relevant section using the quick links below\\\\nTo breakdown this craziness behind the 10 min delivery, our team downloaded Zepto and made a quick order. We made sure that the order contained a mix of meat, fruits & milk (their highest margin items). Zepto delivered this order in less than 13 minutes!\\\\nWe also looked at a ton of user interviews and founder interviews on YouTube to understand the Zepto business model in depth.\\\\nEverything you see here is a result of mix of original research gathered from the internet and the users of Zepto. Here are the 5 key pieces that allow Zepto to deliver your order in 10 minutes or less!\\\\n1. Darkstores & Microwarehouses:\\\\nDarkstores are physical warehouses where all the items you see on the Zepto app are placed in. When you order anything, a Zepto delivery executive picks up all your items from one of these dark stores and brings it to you.\\\\nUnlike traditional retail stores, you cannot go to a dark store and buy your grocery items. Dark stores can only be accessed by Zepto‚Äôs team members and their vendors.\\\\nDark stores are the sole reason why Zepto is able to deliver some orders in under 10 minutes. By being in close proximity to a dense urban are, they are able to deliver your order quickly.\\\\nFor example, let‚Äôs consider Indiranagar in Bangalore.\\\\nBy placing a warehouse in this location, Zepto will be able to service all these neighbourhoods in under 10 minutes.\\\\nIf the order frequency and retention is good, the dark stores will max out almost instantly. Then they could either add more deliver partners to the same dark store or simplu open up one more dark store nearby!\\\\nWhat happens if that dark store also reaches a bottleneck?\\\\nIn that case, Zepto opens up another dark store to meet demands.\\\\nBut thanks to their experienced leadership team, all these expansion decisions are backed by data. They take into account geography, future growth potential, traffic, weather, driver availability & much more before they even think about opening a new dark store.\\\\n2. Super Quick Packaging\\\\nThe founding principles of Zepto has always been impeccable operations backed by custom built software. That‚Äôs how they scaled their first store and that‚Äôs the same principle they‚Äôre using for all their stores across India.\\\\nOnce you place an order, an operations executive inside their warehouse will get two things\\\\nA list of all the items in your orders\\\\nA map to navigate themselves inside the warehouse to pickup all the items in the least amount of time\\\\nThe second point is what truly allows Zepto to become a kingpin on operational efficiency üöÄ. As their CTO Kaivalya Arora says, ‚ÄòWe have designed the process to make sure the entire order is dispacted in 60 - 90 seconds‚Äô\\\\nThis means that the rest of the time is entirely spent on the last mile delivery, thereby easing some pressure on the delivery partner.\\\\nThis brings us onto our third point\\\\n3. Internal Structure of the warehouses\\\\nOperational efficiency is the name of the game when it comes to any operations heavy business. And Zepto achieves operational efficiency in a class of its own üßóüèº‚ôÄÔ∏è.\\\\nThe operations have streamlined the entire warehouse with a data led approach. They‚Äôve looked at the items which move the quickest and have placed it closer to the entrance. Groceries which are not frequenlty ordered are de-prioritised and placed at the back.\\\\nThe creative below will give you an idea of how a darkstore might be structured based on the order frequency of different items. Although this structure is just an example and is subject to change based on several other factors.\\\\nBut Multiply this structural formula with item size, refrigeration needs, fragility & you will get a repeatable model of how to design all your warehouses at scale üöÄ\\\\nFor example, fruits & vegetables are one of their most important and highest margin categories. Hence they have decided to place them in shelves closer to the entrance, where they‚Äôre very easy grab and place into delivery bags.\\\\nTo draw parallels, this is very similar to how the founders of McDonalds designed their Kitchen to complete customer orders in less than two minutes ü§Ø\\\\nIf you haven‚Äôt seen ‚ÄòThe Founder‚Äô on Netflix, this is an open call to see it ASAP. If you‚Äôre working in an operations heavy business or interested in building one, please remember that operational efficiency is crucial for your long term success.\\\\nBut, how do you design superfast systems even when human decisions are part of the system?\\\\nA human operator has to look at the order and decide the chronological order of items in the delivery bag. This takes time and there is also the risk of human errors. Items might be missed or fragile items might end up getting placed at the bottom of the bag (No one likes to have their eggs & tomatoes crushed under a watermelon ‚òπÔ∏è)\\\\nSo the team came up with a pretty simple solution - Give a tablet like device to each operations executive in the darkstore. It works like a Google map, guiding the executive to pickup the items placed in the warehouse.\\\\nOnce the operator is assigned an order, they are told where and how to pick each item in a chronological order.\\\\nTheir CTO Kaivalya says ‚ÄúWe wanted to remove human decisions as much as possible. So each of our executives have a handheld software device driving them through the most optimal pathway‚Äù\\\\nThis system works like a charm and has allowed them to exponentially open new dark stores across India üöÄ, while maintaining quality control.\\\\n4. Incredibly short distances to delivery:\\\\nBigBasket took anywhere between 3 hours to a day to deliver a bag of groceries, while Zepto does it in 10 minutes. A lot of this speed is heavily owed to a warehouse that is present in close proximity to an urban location. This is just simple physics bringing down the time of the last mile delivery.\\\\nSince the distances are closer, the delivery executives are also able to fulfill their orders quicker. Moreover with customers who order frequently, Zepto can assign the same set of delivery partners to fullfil their orders. Since they are well acquainted with the location of the customers, this brings the Time To Deliver even lower üëçüèº.\\\\n5. Driver‚Äôs Familiarity with their locality:\\\\nThe operations team at Swiggy use incredibly sophisticated Machine Learning models to bring down the total deliver time. Right from choosing which partner gets which order to how many order each partner picks up.\\\\nThis allows the delivery partner to\\\\nPickup multiple order and deliver them on the way\\\\nDeliver one order and pickup an order from a nearby hotel\\\\nTo even give you a rough estimation, Swiggy has to calculate four things before assigning a delivery partner to your order.\\\\nThis gets more complex when the delivery executive has to pickup one more order or has to deliver one more order on the way to your house.\\\\nIf you thought that was complex, think about assigning a delivery partner at random. Sometimes they might be familiar with your area. Sometimes they might not be familiar with your locality. Now combine this with traffic and other humane errors!\\\\nWith Zepto, some of these problems like Prep Time are naturally removed due to the nature of the business. Since the drivers are also operating in a familiar locality, the first mile & last mile times are brought down significantly.\\\\nHere‚Äôs how the Zepto would calculate time for a delivery partner who‚Äôs already at the darkstore\\\\nThe human factor is definitely one of the bigger advantages of Zepto. In a matter of weeks, the delivery partners become familiar with each road and each shortcut. Familiarity breeds speed and the delivery partners get quick with time.\\\\nIf you‚Äôre interested about how Swiggy does their driver routing, please do give this and this a read üëçüèº\\\\n2. How does Zepto make money üí∏?\\\\nWe‚Äôve seen how Zepto operates from a micro and a macro view. They store groceries in a darkstore and deliver them with the help of their delivery partners. But all this seems like a costly affair to run. They have to pay rent for each darkstore, salaries for darkstore operators & payments for delivery partners. These are fixed operating costs to Zepto.\\\\nAdd this on top of the tech, product & marketing costs, it‚Äôll give you a fair idea of the amount of money required to keep Zepto alive. So how does Zepto earn money selling groceries?\\\\nHere are the five ways they are currently earning money ü§ë, along with one potential way Zepto they can earn money in the future üöÄ\\\\n1. Margins on each individual product:\\\\nThe most common way grocery delivery startups earn money is on the margins of each individual product. This model is similar to the retailers who buy goods at a lower cost from distributors and sell it at a higher price ‚úÖ\\\\nFor example, let‚Äôs assume that Zepto sells a kg of onion for a price of 24 rupees. They earn margins on this by buying a large quantity from a distributor at a lower price.\\\\nWe went to the internet and checked for prices of onions from distributors. The prices range from anywhere between 10 rupees/ kg to 20 rupees/ kg.\\\\nIf they are able to tie up with a buyer at the lowest price, this is definitely a win win for both of them. Because Zepto gets onion at a lower price and the distributor also gets his order fulfilled almost frequently leading to repeatable revenue numbers.\\\\nFor starters we did some calculations as to how much revenue Zepto could earn from just one warehouse and from onion üß†\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume that Zepto orders 100 kg of onion for one of its warehouses in Bandra every day.\\\\nThe price of one kilogram of onion comes around to 10 rupees.\\\\nSo let‚Äôs assume that the total cost to Zepto along with transportation is 1200 rupees.\\\\nLet‚Äôs also assume an ideal state where they are able to sell the entire 100 kg over the same day.\\\\nWe know that zepto currently sells onion at a price of 24 rupees/ kg.\\\\nNow that‚Äôs 2400 rupees before taxes & other charges.\\\\nNot bad for 100 kgs of onion sold in just one darkstore.\\\\nAccording to their CTO, Kaivalya -‚ÄùPotatoes, Onion, Tomatoes are some of our highest selling items on Zepto. Fruits & vegetables also happen to be one of the highest margin items on our platform‚Äù\\\\nOnion is just one category here. One look into Zepto and you‚Äôll see hundreds of vegetables, fruits, and quick perishable items, all of which are high margin items on Zepto!\\\\n2. Handling Charges\\\\nHandling charge is the fee collected by Zepto to organise, pack and dispatch the items on your list. We clicked on the ‚Äòinformation‚Äô button to understand more about this handling charge and we were thrown the following message - ‚ÄúHandling charge is levied to ensure the products are handled, packed & dispatched safely‚Äù\\\\nWe tried to see if a handling charge is levied by all grocery delivery platforms in India\\\\nSwiggy Instamart - Yes, they had a handling charge\\\\nBigBasket NOW - They had something called a delivery token, but it seemed very similar to this handling charge\\\\nBlinkit - Surprisingly, they did not have a handling charge\\\\nWe figured that the handling charge was not a set standard across all grocery delivery platforms. So this is something that is levied by platforms in different ways.\\\\n3. Delivery Charges\\\\nThis is the second bigger piece of solving the profitability equation for most delivery grocery startups. Delivery charge is a big incredibly important for solving profitability because\\\\nNo matter the size of the order, Zepto has to pay the same delivery fee to their delivery partner\\\\nBut high delivery charges can also be a reason why users stop buying from Zepto\\\\nThe key here is to find the balance between waiving delivery charges and growing profitably üí™üèº. Zepto has solved this problem by choosing to charge customers for orders with a low value basket size. However if you break a certain threshold, you‚Äôll unlock the option to get a ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô\\\\nIncreasing the threshold to unlock free delivery does two things\\\\nIncreases the AOV of each order by encouraging customer to order more\\\\nImprove revenue by charging delivery fee on orders with low AOV\\\\nThe net benefit is aimed at increasing overall revenue from the ‚Äòdelivery fee‚Äô lever. But it might also reduce the overall order frequency for certain ICPs who are Power users. High delivery fees might discourage users who use Zepto to order everything at the last minute.\\\\nHence this a profit lever the ‚ÄòGrowth Team‚Äô must constantly tweak and experiment with data!\\\\nBut the fact is that people are tier 1 cities are increasingly favouring CONVENIENCE >>> MONEY. Our hypothesis is that most folks won‚Äôt mind paying a delivery fee of 25 - 50 get their order delivered.\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume that Sheila orders from Zepto 6 times a week\\\\n‚Üí Even if she gets 3 free deliveries a week, we still have 3 deliveries where Zepto earns a revenue\\\\n‚Üí If she‚Äôs paying 35/ delivery, that‚Äôs 105 rupees for a week.\\\\n‚Üí Extrapolate that across a month and Zepto has earned a revenue of 420 rupees.\\\\n‚Üí Assuming there are 100 customers like her in one dark store, Zepto has just earned 42,000 rupees just from deliveries.\\\\nYou should note that these these numbers are highly speculative and can vary a lot. But you get the gist. Done right, Zepto can find a balance between earning from delivery charges while also maintaining the user frequency ü´Ç\\\\nOne interesting fact to note that if your order is less than 50 rupees, Zepto levies a fee of ‚ÄòSmall Cart Fee‚Äô of Rupees 35. This will incentivise the user to add more to their cart quite naturally!\\\\n4. Product Customisations:\\\\nUser Research is something we push actively in the GrowthX experience. Before you hypothesize any solution, you should always seek to understand your users and their problems.\\\\nIn Zepto‚Äôs case, it‚Äôs safe to say that they‚Äôve identified their customers and their problems incredibly well. One good example is under their fruits and vegetables section\\\\nRight from peeled onion, to cut carrots & loose corn. They have identified ways to take existing vegetables, customize them and increase their prices üöÄ\\\\nFor example:\\\\n500 grams of carrot costs 45 rupees.\\\\nBringing it down to 100 grams this costs just 9 rupees.\\\\nBut 200 grams of peeled carrots costs 53 rupees on Zepto.\\\\nBringing this down to 100 grams costs a whopping 26 rupees\\\\nBy simply washing and cutting up the carrots, they have found ways to increase their margins on their products.\\\\nSimple economics shows a 300% increase in price ü§Ø just by customising the product a bit.\\\\nSure you‚Äôll have to buy expensive machinery or employ people to help with these customisation. But if Zepto is able to achieve good volumes, this cost will also go down as it‚Äôs fixed!\\\\nZepto definitely nailed ‚ÄòPeople don‚Äôt buy your product, they buy the solution that can be achieved with your product‚Äô ü§òüèº\\\\n5. Product Ads:\\\\nProduct Ads are a proven way to earn predictable revenue in most e-commerce and marketplace businesses. Zepto also pulls this off Product Ads in a flawless manner\\\\nAlmost everyone in the grocery space uses product ads as a monetary lever.\\\\nThe concept is simple: If you‚Äôre a retailer, you can give money to Zepto to feature your products at the top of certain searches & categories.\\\\nFor example, Bru features their ‚ÄòBru Instant Pure Coffee Jar‚Äô at the first position for the keyword ‚Äòcoffee.\\\\n6. Membership:\\\\nThis is a model Zepto hasn‚Äôt experimented yet, but proves to a very solid model for predictable revenue growth. Swiggy has already rolled out this membership model in the name of ‚ÄòSwiggy One‚Äô.\\\\nBy subscribing to their membership, you can get\\\\nFree deliveries on all orders\\\\nNo surge fees\\\\nBetter discounts\\\\nOther ecommerce startups also have similar models like\\\\nAmazon‚Äôs ‚ÄòAmazon Prime‚Äô,\\\\nFlipkart‚Äôs ‚ÄòFlipkart Plus‚Äô &\\\\nMeesho‚Äôs upcoming membership model.\\\\nThe membership will model will allow Zepto to predict how their revenue will grow with certainty. It can also be beneficial since it increase customer retention and serves as a good moat!\\\\nWe will have to wait and see if Zepto also rolls out this feature in the future!\\\\nüí°\\\\nBy the way, the depth you see here is just a feeler of the depth we teach at GrowthX üí´\\\\nGrowthX is an invite-only club of over 3000 members who are product, marketing, and business leaders, and founders from top internet-first companies like Google, Canva, CRED, Stripe, Netflix, and more üíé\\\\nWe teach our members how to scale revenues via frameworks that can be applied starting next Monday morning.

This growth is possible because they had a structured approach to growth in the first place. Be it creating marketing copies or opening up new darkstores, everything has a structure in place.\\\\nIn this section we will create a structured Growth strategy for Zepto to reach a business goal in a specific period of time.\\\\n1. Who is Zepto‚Äôs Ideal customer?\\\\nBefore we nail down on Zepto‚Äôs ICP, let‚Äôs look at a couple of practical use cases of Zepto\\\\nYou have a few visitors at home and you need to serve them snacks. Maybe you order some fruits and snack items on Zepto for your visitors\\\\nYou are prepping for breakfast when you realise the batter you have has expired. So you go to Zepto and order for some fresh ID dosa batter\\\\nYou are preparing lunch when you realise that you don‚Äôt have any onions left for dinner. Maybe you order some onions along with a fresh set of groceries for the next three days\\\\nYou feel the need to snack and want some biscuits and chips. So you go to Zepto to order some snacks along with essential groceries for the week\\\\nYou step into the washroom to brush your teeth, only to realise you are out of paste. You quickly open Zepto and get some paste delivered in the next 10 minutes\\\\nThese are just a tiny subset of the use cases of Zepto. Also most of these examples were just around groceries. Zepto also has a ton of other sub categories like\\\\nCleaning Essentials\\\\nMakeup items\\\\nBaby care\\\\nBath & Body care\\\\nElectricals & Accessories\\\\n& much more\\\\nA simple probability check will show you that the use cases are in the thousands (and growing as Zepto plans to add new categories ü§òüèº). Before you build any growth strategy, you need to find a way to bucket these millions of users & use cases into something consumable.\\\\nThis look into Zepto‚Äôs ideal customer is nothing perfect. But it will give you a solid foundation into Zepto‚Äôs primary users.\\\\nWe have borrowed these insights from the assignment submitted by one of our members - Aadeesh Deshpande (GX12).

This table is nowhere close to perfect. We‚Äôre sure that the growth team inside Zepto will have more data points on this.\\\\nBut this table gives you a basic overview into\\\\nWho are buying from Zepto?\\\\nWhy are they buying from Zepto?\\\\nWhat are they buying from Zepto?\\\\nAnd their major blockers to spend more on Zepto\\\\nWith these characteristics in mind, let‚Äôs take a peek into the market sizing of Zepto üëáüèº\\\\n2. Understanding the market (TAM, SAM, SOM)\\\\nIn an interview with Master‚Äôs Union, their CTO Kaivalya Arora says ‚Äúwe went from 5 to 77+ dark stores from Sep to Dec, 2022‚Äù\\\\nThis massive growth is backed by some of the top investors in the market like Nexus, Glade Brook & YCombinator. This is even after there are tons of grocery startups in the market like Instamart, Blinkit and let‚Äôs not forget Tata‚Äôs BigBasket!\\\\nThis is possible because of the nature & scale of the grocery business in India üáÆüá≥\\\\nTheir CEO points the scale of the grocery & essential industry in a beautiful way - ‚ÄúDmart has built a $40 Billion dollar business in a matter of 20 years. If we can even capture a portion of that volume, we can build a profitable business effectively‚Äù\\\\nSo the question is\\\\n‚ùì\\\\nHow big is the grocery market and how much market share is available for Zepto?\\\\nIndia is a massive country with a total population of 1.5 billion people ü§Ø\\\\nBut Zepto cannot cater to this entire base as most of them are located in Tier 2+ cities & rural areas. Maybe Zepto will tap everyone in India (in the future) or maybe we‚Äôll have a Tier 2+ focused startup like Meesho focusing on just that market!\\\\nBut for the foreseeable future, Zepto will only be focusing on the folks living in Tier1+ cities with Annual salaries greater than 10 lakh/ annum\\\\nKartik Narang (GX10), a fellow GrowthX member and Capabilities & Insights Analyst McKinsey laid out this TAM calculation in an incredible manner in one of his acquisition assignmentsüöÄ\\\\nCondition\\\\nCalculation\\\\nTotal Population in Tier 1 Cities in India\\\\n70 Million\\\\nPercentage of People between 20 & 40 years of age\\\\n40%\\\\nTotal Population in Tier 1 cities between the age of 20 - 40\\\\n28 Million\\\\nPercentage of Annual Income greater than 10 lakhs\\\\n40%\\\\nTotal Population in Tier 1 cities between the age 20 - 40 with Annual Income greater than 10 lakhs\\\\n11.2 Million\\\\nAverage number of people per household\\\\n4\\\\nTotal Number of houses that can be reached\\\\n11.2/ 4 ‚áí 3 Million households\\\\n„Ö§\\\\n„Ö§\\\\nThe total TAM in terms of the number of households can be assumed anywhere between 3 to 7 million based on the variations in the following categories\\\\nSwati Poddar (GX9), another fellow GrowthX member and PM at Walmart has smartly converted this into revenue numbers by multiplying the TAM with the average spend on groceries for each household. This was also an acquisition assignment as part of the GrowthX learning experience.\\\\nüí°\\\\nBy the way, the depth you see here is just a feeler of the depth we teach at GrowthX üí´\\\\nGrowthX is an invite-only club of over 3000 members who are product, marketing, and business leaders, and founders from top internet-first companies like Google, Canva, CRED, Stripe, Netflix, and more üíé\\\\nWe teach our members how to scale revenues via frameworks that can be applied starting next Monday morning.

Career outcomes: Over 35% of members are founders & are able to hire growth teams to scale revenue for their companies while operators are able to get into breakout leadership roles.\\\\nExplore GrowthX Membership üèÜ\\\\nBy Swati‚Äôs calculation with a TAM of 7 Million and an average household grocery spend of 10,000 rupees/ month, the revenue TAM comes down to 704 crores/ month\\\\nWe can say that Swati‚Äôs TAM is way different from Kartik‚Äôs TAM Calculations. But this doesn‚Äôt mean that one of their calculations are wrong.\\\\nTAM calculation is all about making informed assumptions with the data we have in mind\\\\nIn Swati‚Äôs case, she considered the average number of people/ household as 2.5. Hence the major difference in the overall TAM number. In essence, TAM is just to give you an idea about the potential size of the market. It is always changing and is never a number set in stone üöÄ\\\\nHere‚Äôs how the TAM Range will look based on same average household grocery spend of 10,000 rupees/ month ‚è¨\\\\nTAM (In Terms of number of households)\\\\n3 Million\\\\n4 Million\\\\n5 Million\\\\n6 Million\\\\n7 Million\\\\nAvg Household Spend On Groceries\\\\n10,000\\\\n10,000\\\\n10,000\\\\n10,000\\\\n10,000\\\\nTAM (In Terms of Total Achievable Revenue)\\\\n300 Crores/ month\\\\n400 Crores/ month\\\\n500 Crores/ month\\\\n600 Crores/ month\\\\n700 Crores/ month\\\\nWhen you start gathering more data points, you can also do TAM Calculations based on different ICPs and customer segments. This can help you decide everything from Growth strategies to overall product positioning and key business decisions ü§ôüèº\\\\n3. Zepto‚Äôs Growth Strategy\\\\nBased on this market & ICP research, we can create a Growth Strategy for Zepto. The growth strategy contains five main levers which are\\\\nAcquisition\\\\nOnboarding\\\\nEngagement & Retention\\\\nMonetisation\\\\nBuilding a Growth Team\\\\nBut all of these levers don‚Äôt mean anything when you don‚Äôt understand the core goal.\\\\nWe have built this growth strategy using the same foundations we teach our members as part of the GrowthX Learning Experience. If you also want to create structured and outcome driven growth model like this for your startup, check out our experience here üí™üèº\\\\nWhat is Zepto‚Äôs goal for the next 2 - 5 years?\\\\nIf you ask us, we definitely have no clue. So that‚Äôs why we are going to hypothesize their goals based on two things\\\\nTheir current growth numbers\\\\nFounder Interviews on YouTube\\\\nLooking at both, one things becomes very clear. One of their current goals is to grow as quickly as possible. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that they don‚Äôt have profitability in mind. They are looking to grow their revenue numbers with the goal of achieving optimal profitability in the next two to five years.\\\\nThey also understand that anyone can copy their business model and quickly overtake them. So their core goal is to also open new dark stores across various markets, establish their presence, gain users & use that as their MOAT!\\\\nIn simple words, you could hypothesise their goal as\\\\n‚Üí Expand to all Tier 1 cities in India and achieve a revenue of XXXX in YYYY number of years\\\\nSince we don‚Äôt have any insider information about Zepto, we‚Äôre just going to assume the revenue number as $500 Million ARR and year as 3. We assume this because Their CEO mentions in one the interviews that they had easily crossed $100 Million ARR a while back.\\\\nSince acquiring new users is going to play a key role, we are going to prioritise Acquisition as our first lever\\\\nSince retaining these users and getting them back is also key to revenue growth & profitabilty, we‚Äôre going to prioritise Engagement & Retention as our second lever\\\\nSince it‚Äôs a mobile app, we need to make sure any user who‚Äôs downloading it, actually ends up using Zepto. We‚Äôre focusing on our Onboarding lever as the third priority\\\\nFinally, we cannot let profitability be an afterthought. It also needs a bit of focus fro the get go. So we‚Äôre going with our Monetisation lever as the fourth priority\\\\nOnce we break down all these levers, we‚Äôll get a very clear idea on how to build our Growth team. Some common questions like\\\\nWho To Hire?\\\\nWhen To Hire?\\\\nBudgets For Hiring?\\\\nWhich are must have roles and good to have roles?\\\\nNOTE: Your growth strategy is not set in stone. Based on the business goals, the market conditions and tons of other factors, your growth strategy will always be evolving. The best growth minds are always aware of this and are willing to tweak their strategies based on the macro and micro changes üöÄ.\\\\n4. Acquisition\\\\nWe have defined 4 different ICPs in the ideal customer section. Each ICP has a different set of needs and different marketing strategies that work for them.\\\\nA really good growth team understand this and will tweak their marketing strategies based on the ICP they‚Äôre trying to reach.\\\\nFor this case, we‚Äôre just going to look at ICP 1 - The ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô. These are folks in the age range of 20 - 25 and purchase everything from online grocery platforms like Instamart, Zepto & BigBasket.\\\\nWe will only create a Growth Model for this ICP. Since they have a lot of unplanned purchases, their usage frequency is also very high. Also because they are young and have a lot of disposable income, their ability & willingness to spend is also high.\\\\nThe most common acquisition channels to reach our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô are\\\\nYou can use the quick links below to jump to any specific section in our Acquisition Lever\\\\nNow let‚Äôs break down all the acquisition levers for Zepto‚Äôs growth model\\\\nOrganic\\\\nZepto‚Äôs organic strategy for the ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô has three splits. This is based on how they discover new products and where they usually spend their time on.\\\\nSearch Engine Optimisation (SEO):\\\\nSEO is the art of ranking your business when your ideal customer searches for it. Since SEO is a pull channel, you need to identify the different ways in which your customers might search for your product\\\\nHere are some common themes we were able to identify with Search Engine Optimisation.\\\\nHere‚Äôs the breakdown with some common examples\\\\nMost of the keywords here were occupied by market leaders like Amazon & BigBasket. Currently Zepto doesn‚Äôt seem to have an SEO strategy in place. It‚Äôs website is also pretty basic, displaying just information information only about their organisation.\\\\nFor starters, their main competitor BigBasket brings around 6.4 million website visitors from smartphone traffic alone. It‚Äôs the ideal time for Zepto to think about organic SEO strategies if they‚Äôre certain about building this for the long term üöÄ\\\\nTo start with SEO, they need to invest in a website strategy that ties in with their app usage. Most of their users will use Zepto on their app. But the website is primarily to build pages and capture the SEO traffic.\\\\nEventually Zepto will also have to build a full scale website like BigBasket if they want to tap into the fullscale SEO potential.\\\\nApp Store Optimisation(ASO):\\\\nSince Zepto is a mobile app first business, App Store & Play Store discovery is a high priority. App Store Optimisation is the art of ranking your app for relevant searches and in the relevant categories.\\\\nASO can also be broken down into the three types of searches, which we have broken down in the Whimsical below\\\\nApart from search, you also need to ensure your app is free from technical glitches and bugs. Pair this with a healthy number of positive reviews, your app will also be displayed in top positions under\\\\nRelated Applications\\\\nTop Free Apps\\\\nTrending Apps\\\\netc..\\\\nYour best bet is to make sure your app\\\\nIs free from technical glitches\\\\nHas an incredible user experience\\\\nTons of Positive Reviews (Possibly 4+ stars)\\\\nSocial Media:\\\\nSocial Media is yet another untapped opportunity for Zepto. One of the reasons we suggest social media is because\\\\nSwiggy, Zomato and a lot of D2C, FMCg brands have been doubling down on Organic social for the same reasons. While it requires constant effort and a lot of experimentation to stay relevant on social, the efforts gradually pay off.\\\\nSince the ‚ÄòYoung Gun‚Äô ICPs are extremely young and spend a lot of time on social media applications, it makes perfect sense ü§òüèº\\\\nThe Social Media strategy would be a mix of long form content (For YouTube etc) and Short form content (for YouTube Shorts & Reels)\\\\nLong Form Content ‚Üí\\\\nThe general theme of long form content is to provide value first. We can start with things ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô might already be searching for. Since some of them might be living alone, some ideas could be\\\\nCooking Tips\\\\nHome Cleaning Tips\\\\nHealthy Eating Tips\\\\netc‚Ä¶.\\\\nShort Form Content ‚Üí\\\\nShort form content should focus on funny anecdotes and things these folks might find relatable.\\\\nFunny Reels\\\\nRelatable Memes\\\\nQuick Informational Videos\\\\netc‚Ä¶.\\\\nHowever considering the entire macro, social media needs to be inclusive of all ICPs. It should not just be relatable to our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô. The overall brand persona and positioning should also be in mind when creating these strategies.\\\\nZepto has had a very heavy reliance on PAID Ads to grow. It is fair given how their business is location dependant and Paid is the best channel for location based targeting.\\\\nSince PAID Ads can be customised and deployed quite quickly, it‚Äôs Time To Value from them is much quicker. Paid Ads can be divided into three sub categories\\\\nThese are advertisements that will be displayed on search engines like Google, Bing and other platforms. The targeting here is based on individual keywords, rather than just interests or demographic data üöÄ\\\\nProduct Ads:\\\\nProduct based ads which focus on specific products can be extremely useful for Zepto. They have two strategies for product base search ads\\\\nProducts that are low AOV, but high margins (fruits, vegetables etc..)\\\\nProducts that are high AOV, but low margin (Oil, Atta etc..)\\\\nProducts that have a high purchase frequency, but low AOV & ROI (Snacks, Quick Munchies)\\\\nWhich products they want to go after is entirely dependant on a strategy backed by data üíΩ\\\\nBrand Ads:\\\\nBrand Ads can be used for keywords where someone is searching for your product, but you don‚Äôt have the sub pages ready for it.\\\\nOr you can also use it to capitalise on the Inbound search terms until SEO kicks in.\\\\nBrand Ads can also be used to kick out competitors for products which Zepto thinks will give them good retention.\\\\nCompetitor Ads:\\\\nThese ads can be run over competitor pages or also be run over products which Zepto‚Äôs competitor‚Äôs are ranking for. Yet again, this can be used to capture a new market, a new product if you think they might help with your retention rates.\\\\nSocial Ads:\\\\nSocial ads come in really handy when you‚Äôre trying to target based on location, interests or both.\\\\nIf Zepto is trying to scale up each individual dark store chronologically, this is a great way to reach customers. You can target based on age, interests, gender & more based on the data platforms given by advertising platforms ü§òüèº\\\\nWe need to be mindful of two things when running social ads\\\\nWhat‚Äôs the key value proposition for this ICP?\\\\nHow do we convert that into our messaging?\\\\nWhich social platforms are they most active in?\\\\nAs we‚Äôre just focusing on the ‚ÄòYoung Gun‚Äô ICP, we also need to make sure the messaging is on point for them. Their messaging can be derived from their Key Value Propositions such as\\\\n10 Min Delivery\\\\nFresh Groceries At Your Doorstep\\\\nSave Time\\\\nHere‚Äôs how a static ad might look for them on a social media platform\\\\nHere‚Äôs an example of a dynamic ad for Zepto.\\\\nIt‚Äôs both quirky and conveys the Key Value Proposition under 15 seconds. Perfect for social media platforms\\\\nWhile running social ads, we also need to mindful of the platforms each ICP is active on. Our ICP is active on Instagram, Snapchat & Facebook which are all good platforms to start with üé¢\\\\nApp Store Ads:\\\\nSince they‚Äôre an app first platform, it makes a lot of sense to prioritise App Store Ads when you‚Äôre starting with the paid channel. The grocery market is a bit mature thanks to old players like BgBasket, Blinkit and other incumbents\\\\nSo it‚Äôs Zepto‚Äôs best bet to capitalise on the existing search volume on these platforms üöÄ\\\\nApp Store Ads can also be of two types as shown below\\\\nThese ad formats are a different beast in themselves. For the sake of keeping this short we are skipping the technicalities in this section for now.\\\\nThere‚Äôs an universal truth we need to understand before we get into Product Integrations. No app, product or business exists out there in Unison. While your customer is using your product, they are also simultaneously using multiple other products at the same time.\\\\nProduct Integration is the concept of seeking a natural fit with the products used by your users and integrating with them.\\\\nBut some ground rules before we seek Product Integrations\\\\nThe Product should not be a direct competitor to Zepto\\\\nThe Product Integration pitch should feel natural and personalised\\\\nThe product should also have good trust (as trust can be destroyed by partnering with a wrong brand)\\\\nThe product should preferably have the same or higher usage frequency than Zepto\\\\nFrom user interviews conducted by GrowthX members, we have discovered that Zepto users also use some products like UrbanClap, Netflix, Hotstar, EatFit etc‚Ä¶\\\\nHere are some interesting product integrations we can work out with the following products\\\\nUrban Company\\\\nHotstar\\\\nEatFit\\\\nThese are just some examples from the top of our head. Once you do more intense customer research, you will be able to find better products that have a better fit with your offerings.\\\\nPartnerships are lesser known ways to get your brand in front of tons of new customers. Zepto can approach partnerships in two different ways\\\\nInfluencer Partnerships\\\\nProduct Placements\\\\nEach has their merit and difference in their payback periods!\\\\nInfluencer Led Partnerships\\\\nThis essentially focuses on partnering with influencers whom your audience are also hooked into. Most of these partnerships are based on behavioural insights which can be derived from customer calls, surveys etc.\\\\nSince we‚Äôre trying to reach the ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô, we will start with the platforms they‚Äôre most active on - IG & YouTube. Step 2 is understanding the themes or which channels/ pages they follow.\\\\nWe know that this persona is focused on improving their career. So a good place to start is with channels that focus on ‚ÄòCareer specific advice‚Äô. Some of them could also be interested in cooking channels üï∫üèº.\\\\nThe main idea is to identify a theme and then double on those specific channels with a solid pitch.\\\\nProduct Placements\\\\nWeb series & movies are a great way to place your products in a subtle manner. The actor sipping on a cold coffee he ordered from Zepto. Or maybe the family member ordering something on Zepto.\\\\nThese are all subtle pitches to place your products in mainstream movies as well as smaller films & web series.\\\\nUnacademy pulled this off incredibly well with their product placements in tv series like Kota Factory, Operation MBBS etc. Product Placements should feel like natural and in sync with the plot. The core idea is to solidify Zepto as a product everyone uses casually in their life.\\\\nOffline ads probably have one of the best product-channel fits for Zepto because of their hyperlocal nature. When done right, this channel can solve for discovery for a very specific set of ICPs in one location. The best ICP to start with is our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô\\\\nHere are a couple of offline channel ideas to target ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô in their daily life\\\\nThey mostly take an Ola or Uber to reach their workplace\\\\nWe can place ads in autos & cabs behind the driver‚Äôs seat\\\\nThey might take a bus or the use the metro train\\\\nWe can also place banners in specially designated boards at these stops\\\\nThey will use the lift atleast twice a day in their office space\\\\nWe can place an ad inside the lift walls\\\\nThey will walk past the lobby in their office space (preferably an IT park)\\\\nWe can place custom booths that encourage people to download and try Zepto\\\\nOffline channels come in a variety of ways and help us target folks in a very specific locality!\\\\nFor most consumer led applications, referrals can be an incredible acquisition tool. Since our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô are highly social and tech savvy, referral can have a good product market fit for them.\\\\nAll good referral programs will nail 4 things in depth\\\\nThe reward for both the referrer and the referee\\\\nWhy will someone refer?\\\\nWhen will someone refer?\\\\nHow easy it is to refer?\\\\nEach section can use a separate page in reality. But for this guide, we‚Äôre going to focus on Zepto and our target ICP - ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô.\\\\nWhy will someone refer Zepto?\\\\nAt the heart of every successful referral program lies an incredible customer experience. The best reason someone will refer Zepto is when they have a great experience with it. A great experience is delivered when\\\\nThey get their order in under 15 minutes\\\\nThe items are fresh and undamaged\\\\nThe packaging is good\\\\nThey get exactly what they ordered for (not something different - happens frequently in grocery delivery apps)\\\\nTheir AOV of each order is high (Depth)\\\\nThey keep ordering multiple times a week (frequency)\\\\nThe idea here is to identify when someone has a good experience and then take them to the referral loop\\\\nWhen will someone refer Zepto?\\\\nThe discovery of the referral loop should always be placed in the ‚ÄòHappy Flow‚Äô of the customer.\\\\nSome examples of happy flows are\\\\nAfter a customer receives their order in under 15 minutes\\\\nAfter a customer has submitted a review\\\\nThe goal is to identify screens where the user is in a ‚ÄòHappy Flow‚Äô yet it still won‚Äôt hinder the primary goal (complete an order)\\\\nWhat is the reward?\\\\nA good reward does two things\\\\nEnables the customer to keep referring\\\\nEnables the new customers to & old customers to keep using the app\\\\nIn that frame of mind, rewards should be app specific and increase the usage of the app. Monetary rewards are good, but they prevent the users from investing the reward back into the app.\\\\nApp specific coins, coupons and dicsounts are always good currencies for a referral system. One such reward is Zepto‚Äôs ‚ÄòZepto cash‚Äô. It provides both the referrer and the referee with credits they can only use in Zepto.\\\\nHow easy is it to refer?\\\\nEase of a referral system depends on two things\\\\nDiscovery of the referral system\\\\nAbility to Track your referrals\\\\nDiscovery can be solved by showing the referral link in all the ‚ÄòHappy Flows‚Äô and also on the sidebar.\\\\nAbility to track referrals is important because it allows the referrer to understand where his referees are\\\\nHave they clicked on the link\\\\nHave the downloaded the app\\\\nHave they made their first transaction\\\\nBut building a referral program like this is resource intensive and takes up a lot of development effort (even with the use of tools!)\\\\nA good idea is to run a test to a small population before deploying it to tons of users. Some things that can be tested are\\\\nRewards for referee\\\\nRewards for referrer\\\\nPlacement of the referral link\\\\nTracking of the referral link\\\\nDifferent ways to share the referral link\\\\nHere are some metrics Zepto can track to ensure the success of it‚Äôs referral program\\\\nNumber of active users sending invites\\\\nNumber of invites per referrer\\\\nConversion rate to link clicks\\\\nConversion rate to app downloads\\\\nConversion rate to first purchase\\\\nConversion rate to first review\\\\nSo that‚Äôs all about the acquisiton strategies for Zepto ü§òüèº. Now let‚Äôs take a look into the next most important lever for Zepto‚Äôs success - E&R.\\\\nEngagement & Retention are the holy grail of building a successful product in any market. We could even go further and say, Engagement & Retention are the pillars of any successful business.\\\\nGood engagement leads to better retention.\\\\nBetter retention leads to revenue and word of mouth.\\\\nGood revenue means you can invest in the best talent, improve the product even more and rule the market\\\\nWord of mouth means that you can now acquire customers at costs that keep getting lower\\\\nAll these combine into a vicious cycle which make any product/ business successful.\\\\nWhere does retention come here?\\\\nSome of the best product teams think about retention right from the Onboarding. It‚Äôs all about helping the user become powerful with the product. Retention is never an afterthought in any successful product. When done right, retention can drive product & even business decisions.\\\\nHow does Engagement & Retention apply to our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nBefore we even dive into the engagement framework for our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô, we need to understand some basic terms üëáüèº\\\\nFrequency of usage - Number of times someones orders from Zepto\\\\nDepth - No of items ordered in each category (Tomato, Onion, Potato under the vegetables section)\\\\nBreadth - No of categories ordered (1 Vegetable, 2 fruits, 1 Bread, 1 oil etc..)\\\\nThese are the 3 pillars of good engagement.\\\\nBased on these pillars we can define users into 3 buckets üëáüèº\\\\nCasual - People who order from Zepto once a week - once every two weeks\\\\nCore - People who order from Zepto two to three times a week\\\\nPower - People who order from Zepto 4+ times a week\\\\nWe are yet again going to pull excerpts from Aadeesh Deshpande‚Äôs (GX12) assignment on Zepto to deep dive into our framework.\\\\nThere are three types of buying habits for Zepto‚Äôs users üëáüèº\\\\nStock Up - Plan & buy groceries for the entire week\\\\nTop Up - Buying items that generally have a low shelf life (Vegetables, fruits, bread, milk etc.)\\\\nUnplanned Purchases - Items that might have run out without knowledge or items that have a sudden need (Oil, masala powders, Alcohol, Snacks etc..)\\\\nHere are some facts we know about our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô from the table we‚Äôve added above\\\\nCharacteristics\\\\nPotential ICP 1\\\\nName\\\\nYoung Guns\\\\nAge\\\\n21 - 26\\\\nIncome\\\\n8 lakhs/ annum+\\\\nRelationship Status\\\\n‚Üí Unmarried\\\\n‚Üí Sometimes in a relationship\\\\nEmployment Status/ Work Experience\\\\n‚Üí Freshly Employed\\\\nCity\\\\nTier 1\\\\nTech Savvy\\\\nYES\\\\nFrequently Used Social Media Apps\\\\nLinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram\\\\nEntertainment Services Used\\\\nDisney+ Hostar, Zee5, Amazon Prime\\\\nEcommerce services used\\\\nBookMyShow, Amazon, Myntra, Nykaa, Swiggy, Zomato, Zepto, Urban Company\\\\nIncome Spent On\\\\n1.

Most of their purchases are last minute and unplanned. We also know that this segment has a ton of disposable income and has a very low barrier of entry to Zepto.\\\\nWe also know that the majority of this segment live in a Tier 1 city which is where Zepto primarily operates. In his research, Aadeesh has quoted a research paper from Redseer which indicates that 70% of all grocery purchases are a mix of unplanned & top-up puchases.\\\\nSo what‚Äôs the engagement campaign for ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nTitle\\\\nContent\\\\nUnderstanding\\\\nWe know that a ton of Young Guns order from Zepto 2 - 3 times a week. But this is only fruits, vegetables & some quick perishables.\\\\nType of user\\\\nAt the moment they are core users\\\\nGoal of the campaign\\\\nGet them to order from other categories like Snacks, Juices, Cleaning Essentials, Electricals etc‚Ä¶\\\\nWe want to eventually increase the breadth of the user and convert them into a power users\\\\nExperiments To Run\\\\n1.

Garam Masala\\\\n2. Curd\\\\n3. Ready to eat Chapatti\\\\n4. Cashew nuts\\\\n5. Desserts (if it‚Äôs dinner)\\\\nWhat does Retention look like for ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nFor Zepto, the best retention happens with both depth (more items in one category) and breadth (ordering from multiple categories). Once they start ordering different items, Zepto becomes the go to place for our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô.\\\\nIncreasing Depth and Breadth makes Zepto their Go-To product which naturally increases their frequency of usage.\\\\nWhich channels drive the best retention for ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nTimely Push Notifications:\\\\nPush Notifications that are backed up data is a great option. Let‚Äôs say one person orders a packet of milk every two days at exactly 9 PM. If they haven‚Äôt ordered milk for the last two days, a push notification asking them to order milk can go out ‚úåüèº\\\\nWhatsApp Notifications:\\\\nWhatsApp notifications can also be triggered as reminders for them.\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume that their favourite milkshake brand was out of stock in their last order. We can run a WhatsApp notification to tell them it‚Äôs back in stock\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume the milk example. We can push a WhatsApp notification to remind them\\\\nSlack or Teams Notifications\\\\nThis is a bit contradictory. But we know that ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô are heavily career focused. So there‚Äôs a very high chance that they may be using an internal communication tool like Slack or Microsoft Teams.\\\\nA quick growth test can be to connect their Slack IDs and send them reminders through them. Although be wary as this is just an hypothesis and hasn‚Äôt been proven by any grocery delivery startup yet!\\\\nWhich Products/ Categories drive the best retention?\\\\nQuick Perishable Items like Milk, Eggs, Bread, Fruits & Vegetables (High freq & high margin)\\\\nFlour, Oil, Rice items\\\\nBathroom & home cleaning equipments\\\\nBath, Body & Hygiene products\\\\nIndulgence items like Biscuits, Chips, Cold drinks, Ice cream etc..\\\\nFinally, why would ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô churn?\\\\nChurn can be divided into two types at the very basic level - Voluntary & Involuntary. Once you understand the reasons someone might churn, your team can work on preventing them. An acute understanding of the reasons can also help you fix issues in your marketing & brand perception\\\\nVoluntary Reasons For Churn\\\\nDelivery Time is too long\\\\nWrong Items were delivered\\\\nItems were delivered to the wrong address\\\\nProducts were damaged during delivery\\\\nExpired products were delivered\\\\nHigh delivery fee\\\\nProducts were out of stock\\\\nInvoluntary Reasons For Churn\\\\nShifted to a new location where Zepto is not available\\\\nOut of town for sometime\\\\nIssue with certain payment portals\\\\nAs you start mapping out all the potential reasons someone might churn, you can trace it back to early signs of churn. For example, if delivery time for a certain user has increased and you see a drop in their frequency, there might be some level of causation at play.\\\\nNegative actions to keep an eye on\\\\nDrop in App Open Rate\\\\nA lot of customer support tickets\\\\nDrop in the frequency of orders\\\\nDrop in basket value\\\\nDrop in weekly/ monthly AOV\\\\nIncrease in Cart Abandonment\\\\nA key concept you should keep in mind. There is a very good difference between causation and correlation.\\\\nIf order frequency is going down while delivery time increases, there is a high chance of relation between the two. But there is also a good chance that there‚Äôs no relation between the two.\\\\nMaybe they had a roommate who just moved out. Hence their order frequency is low\\\\nMaybe they started buying their fruits and vegetables from a street vendor because that was easy\\\\nAs a growth person, before you jump into any conclusions, you need to do the due diligence to understand the reason. You can do this by\\\\nSending a survey,\\\\nLooking at their support tickets\\\\nLooking at the change in items orders before & after change of freq\\\\nScheduling a 1:1 calls with your users\\\\n& more..\\\\nAs a growth person, your goal should be to seek the truth before you confirm your hypotheses.\\\\nWhat are some retention campaigns we can run for our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nThis is an example we‚Äôve pulled out from Aadeesh Deshpande‚Äôs assignment on Zepto. We‚Äôre just tweaking a bunch of the ideas for better presentation.\\\\nConcept\\\\nCampaign Details\\\\nTarget Segment\\\\nCore & Power Users\\\\nTarget ICP\\\\nYoung Guns\\\\nPurchase Behaviour For Core Users\\\\n‚Üí Top Ups and last minute unplanned purchases\\\\n‚Üí Mostly fruits, vegetables, groceries & household items\\\\n‚Üí 5+ products in cart\\\\n‚Üí 3 times a week minimum\\\\nPurchase Behaviour For Power Users\\\\n‚Üí All Categories\\\\n‚Üí 2 to 10 products in cart\\\\n‚Üí 5+ times a week minimum\\\\nGoal\\\\nResurrect Core & Power Users\\\\nCampaign Targeting\\\\nFrequency of orders has reduced.\\\\nReason: Increase in Delivery Time\\\\nProposed Solution\\\\nApologise for the delayed delivery time and compensate with Zepto coins!\\\\nPitch/ Content\\\\nPush Notification on app/ WhatsApp Notification\\\\nWe understand that your time is money.\\\\n3 out of your last 5 deliveries were delayed by more than 15 minutes. Please do accept our apologies in the form on 150 Zepto coins!\\\\nFrequency & Timing of Campaign\\\\nThe notification should be sent one week after the last order. A reminder needs to be sent 15 days after if the user is still not resurrected!\\\\nSuccess Metrics\\\\n‚Üí % of users displaying old purchase frequency after 8 weeks\\\\n‚Üí WOW Retention curve\\\\nOther Micro Metrics To Track\\\\n‚Üí App Notification to Click Ratio\\\\n‚Üí Click to ‚ÄòAdd to cart‚Äô ratio\\\\nReasons this campaign will work\\\\n‚Üí By accepting the honest mistake and offering a reward, the core & power users will be happy to come back\\\\n‚Üí The Zepto coins will further incentivise them to give another chance to Zepto!\\\\nAssociated Risks\\\\n‚Üí If the order is delayed again, user may lose trust in the brand & may never come back again\\\\n‚Üí They may be further offended that we are trying to bring them back with cash incentives\\\\nYou can use the same framework to create multiple resurrection campaigns for all types of users. This level of depth will help you prioritise segments in a massive product like Zepto.\\\\nThe same framework can be used for all other voluntary and involuntary churn. As a growth person, your first priority is to understand the reasons and prioritise the solutions on the cohorts which will have the maximum impact.\\\\n6. Onboarding\\\\nSince we‚Äôve prioritised acquisition and engagement & Retention, we‚Äôre not going to focus on the other two levers on this guide. The superpower every growth person must have is the ability to say ‚ÄòNO‚Äô and prioritise with laser focus.\\\\nEven if you have infinite resources to handle, you need to have focus. Focus will help you solve the most important problems effectively. Moreover focus will help you reach your revenue goals effectively!\\\\nBut if you were to work on the Onboarding lever, here are some metrics you could track\\\\nDownload Metrics\\\\nAdd to basket metrics\\\\nCheckout metrics\\\\n‚Üí Channel wise download metrics:\\\\nAds to Downloads\\\\nFacebook ads to app download\\\\nIG Ads to app download\\\\nOrganic to download\\\\nGoogle search to download\\\\nGoogle play store search to download\\\\nApp store search to download\\\\n‚Üí Add to basket metrics:\\\\nNumber of download to registration\\\\nNumber of registrations to ‚ÄòVisited Homepage‚Äô\\\\nNumber of ‚ÄòVisited Homepage‚Äô to ‚ÄòAdd Items to cart‚Äô\\\\nNumber of ‚ÄòAdd Items to cart‚Äô to ‚ÄòVisited Checkout Page‚Äô\\\\n‚Üí Checkout Metrics:\\\\nNumber of items added to cart\\\\nNumber of categories added to cart\\\\nAverage order value\\\\nNumber of users checked out out with COD\\\\nNumber of users checked out with Credit Cards\\\\nNumber of users checked out with UPI\\\\n‚Üí All these metrics can also be further divided into\\\\nDevice\\\\nPlatform\\\\nAcquisition channel\\\\nDark Store\\\\nGeographical Location\\\\nTime\\\\netc‚Ä¶\\\\nThis is a very broad list of metrics you can track to understand your users. As always the metrics you choose will be dependant on your current revenue goals and business priorities.\\\\n7. Monetisation\\\\nFinally, the most important, yet looked upon growth lever is the monetisation lever. Revenue should never be an afterthought for any business. Since this lever is also not a priority at the moment, we are not going to deep dive into it.\\\\nEven before you work on your monetisation lever, you have to run the ‚ÄòLitmus Test‚Äô to understand your retention. Monetisation only works if atleast a certain subset of your users retain after a certain period of time.\\\\nOnce the litmus test is cleared, the monetisation lever has four categories\\\\nWho to charge?\\\\nWhen to charge?\\\\nWhat to charge?\\\\nHow much to charge?\\\\nand that‚Äôs all about the Growth levers for Zepto.\\\\nüí°\\\\nBy the way, the depth you see here is just a feeler of the depth we teach at GrowthX üí´\\\\nGrowthX is an invite-only club of over 3000 members who are product, marketing, and business leaders, and founders from top internet-first companies like Google, Canva, CRED, Stripe, Netflix, and more üíé\\\\nWe teach our members how to scale revenues via frameworks that can be applied starting next Monday morning.

Why is Zepto well positioned to win?\\\\nZepto has grown at breakneck speeds and we truly believe that can win in the long term. Here are some reasons why\\\\n1. Huge market that‚Äôs growing exponentially:\\\\nThe Indian economy is growing at an exponential pace. What happened in the west 20 years back is happening in India currently. As more capital is being poured into the country, new businesses are being formed every day. This leads to a surplus of capital in the economy.\\\\nCapital that can be used to deploy to make you life easier, like buy groceries from Zepto, instead of going to a shop nearby.\\\\nThe picture below shows an estimate of how the Indian economy will grow in the next 25 years.\\\\nThis is the macro shift that BigBasket definitely missed in its formative years.\\\\n2. Customer trust with internet products is growing exponentially:\\\\nThe Indian consumer segment are slowly starting to understand and trust internet products. Before Ola, Flipkart, Myntra and other startups came into play, spending money on the internet was a challenge. And it was not because of the lack of money\\\\nPeople still had disposable income, but the trust levels were quite low. No one were accustomed to spending money on these consumer apps.\\\\nThe advent of internet apps, paired with JIO and UPI changed this game.\\\\nSpending money on the internet became an everyday thing and this naturally improved the trust levels of consumers. Zepto is well positioned at a time where consumer trust on these internet startups is growing exponentially.\\\\n3. Backed by an experienced leadership team:\\\\nThere‚Äôs a reason why Zepto went from zero to 2000+ employees in a matter of two years. Right from the get go, the founders were keen on hiring experienced leader for their management team.\\\\nThey hired folks who had already done that startup journey in the same or a related field. Some of their most senior hires were\\\\nTheir CFO, Jitendra N was already a VP of Finance at Pharmeasy\\\\nTheir CBO, Viral Jhaveri had worked leadership roles in Uber Eats and FreighTigers\\\\nTheir People function is headed by Roma Bindroo handled the people function at Johnson & Johnson for multiple years\\\\nThe founders understood that Zepto is still an operations heavy business with some software at the front. Even if they make the software 100x better, the operations cannot be avoided.\\\\nThey understood the game and started hiring folks who understood operations heavy businesses in the first place. This allowed them to reduce mistakes and scale faster than ever!\\\\nüöÄ\\\\nIf you‚Äôre a leader or a founder, keen to hire the Top 1% Growth Talent in India, do register to our waiting list here. We have helped 100+ top startups like CRED, PayTm, Swiggy & Dunzo hire their Growth talent.\\\\nPlease do fill out the form and one of our Talent Team superstars will reach back to you üí™üèº\\\\n4. Changing customer behaviour:\\\\nWith the boom of the economy, customer behaviour is also changing constantly. More customers are now starting to value Convenience >> Money.\\\\nStartups like Swiggy, Uber, Urban Company are a true testament to this!\\\\n5. High driver retention rate:\\\\nZepto has a 7% higher delivery driver retention rate than all hyperlocal delivery startups in India. This is because of a couple of reasons\\\\nZero long distance deliveries - Drivers hate nothing more than long distance deliveries\\\\nA centralised hub for all drivers - Since Zepto operates only out of dark stores, this gives them a chance to provide a designated waiting area for delivery partners. The founder mentioned that they also provide their partners with water, snacks & otehr condiments to make their life easier.\\\\nWhile 7% maybe a marginal amount, it can eventually add up. Driver experience is a key piece in winning this hyperlocal war. Since there is no penalty or drivers when they jump ships, the player who retains the most, eventually wins in the long term.\\\\n6. High NPS:\\\\nZepto was founded on the core insight of high NPS from the days of Kiranakart (their old startup). Basically customers who received their orders in less than 15 minutes had a higher NPS compared to customers who got it later.\\\\nSince Zepto is built on this core insight, their NPS is close to 80% (which is spectacular)\\\\n7. High Customer Retention rate:\\\\nYet again, during the days of Kiranakart, the founders realised that customers who recieved orders in less than 15 minutes retained better. The 15 min delivery is a WOW factor, around which Zepto is entirely built out of.\\\\nThis helps them own a retention rate of 60% even with 2 million+ customers & growing!\\\\n8. Wave 2 startups FTW:\\\\nWave 1 startups are the BigBaskets and Flipkarts of India. They faced a lot of challenges in terms of the MACRO\\\\nTalent\\\\nEconomical Growth\\\\nConsumer Trust\\\\nPayments\\\\nConsumer Sentiment etc\\\\nIn the last 10 years however, the entire Macro of India has shifted in favour of startups üëáüèº\\\\nThe talent pool has become denser (lots of people who have been there and done that)\\\\nThe economy has grown and is growing by leaps and bounds\\\\nThe people have more trust on Internet startups\\\\nPaying for something has become incredibly easier (thanks to UPI and all the Fintech startups)\\\\nConsumer have started spending more money rather than just saving it\\\\n9. They have solved for delivery accuracy:\\\\nA big challenge with old age grocery delivery startups is order accuracy. Issues like missing some items or even delivering the wrong items is terrible customer experience. The customer on the other end orders grocieries for convenience. Missed or wrong deliveries is probably the most inconvenient thing for them.\\\\nThe founding team developed Zepto with a razer focus of delivering the right order on time. The pay close attention to the dispatch process and fill any leaks to prevent wrong deliveries.\\\\nOther incumbents like Swiggy Instamart, BigBasket have also fixed this in the recent days. Should be interesting to see how they fare against Zepto in the future.\\\\n10. Expanding to new locations:\\\\nZepto‚Äôs founder mentioned in an interview is doubling in business every three months. This is possible because of their rapid expansion to new locations with a ton of darkstores. Since their inception, Zepto has grown from one store in Mumbai to 75+ locations across Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata and other tier 1 metro cities.\\\\nThis has been possible because of an experienced management team and high focus on creating formalised processes for everything!\\\\n11. Expanding to different categories:\\\\nZepto started with just groceries, but now they‚Äôve expanded to beauty accessories, baby products and even electronics. As they slowly figure out the supply chain and formulate the entire process, they can add more categories to this. An example could be umbrellas & raincoats during monsoon.\\\\nThe sky is the limit when they have the supply chain figured out for everything.\\\\n12. Execution On Point:\\\\nGrocery delivery is not a huge innovation. BigBasket and many other incumbents have already done it and grown massively. Even the 15 min delivery can be figured out by other players in a matter of time.\\\\nThe biggest strength of team Zepto is their ability to execute. Momentum is a very sneaky element that exponentially increases your success.\\\\nWhile other players are changing their business model to fit the 10 min delivery, Zepto is already acing it. The first mover advantage alone will carry them far above the finish line. By providing an incredible service, they can retain to all their customers while other incumbents are still building for the market.\\\\n5. What are the reasons Zepto might also lose in the hyper competitive grocery space?\\\\nThere are always two sides to any coin. If there are a couple of reasons why Zepto will win, there are even more reasons as to why it might lose. We wouldn‚Äôt do justice to this guide without looking at those points too!\\\\n1. Expanding to Tier 2 cities will be a challenge:\\\\nTier 1 cities currently contribute to almost the entire revenue of Zepto. Last time we checked, there were no Zepto owned darkstores in tier 2+ cities. Zepto will reach a plateau as they expand across all tier 1 cities.\\\\nThey can only unlock even more growth when they reach tier 2 cities. However tier 2+ cities are built different in terms of\\\\nPopulation distribution\\\\nMindset\\\\nCustomer sentiment\\\\nBuilding Zepto for tier 2+ cities will require a whole different mindset that the current model. They will have to rethink everything which will require time & a lot of money.\\\\n2. Not all dark stores will be profitable:\\\\nThe cold truth is that not all darkstores will be profitable. Power laws can be crazy in business and a small percentage of the dark stores may end up generating the most amount of revenue.\\\\nThe hard part about this is each darkstore, irrespective of revenue will have a fixed operating cost. This will be split between\\\\nSalaries\\\\nRent\\\\nOther bills\\\\nSo at some point Zepto will have to decide between closing low revenue locations or keeping them alive for just overall brand visibility.\\\\n3. White-labelling products is an operational challenge:\\\\nThere is only so much you can earn from selling other brands. That‚Äôs exactly why so many supermarkets end up creating their own products like rice, oil, bread etc..\\\\nIt allows them to control the supply chain and take a bigger share of the revenue pie.\\\\nHowever producing your own products is also investment heavy. While production is the first challenge, Quality Control & Branding is an even bigger challenge. Acquisitions can come in handy for this play.\\\\nWe‚Äôll just have to wait and see how Zepto play this card out!\\\\n4. Free Delivery might hit on the margins:\\\\nWhile ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô is great for the growth stage, it is not sustainable for overall sustenance. At some point, Zepto will have to cut down on ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô. Or they might also need to increase the minimum threshold for ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô.\\\\nThis might lead to a drop in order frequency and users jumping to competitor products who do offer ‚Äò Free Delivery‚Äô.\\\\n5. Zero Cost Of Switching:\\\\nThe biggest problem with hyperlocal startups like this is the switching cost. Or should we say that there isn‚Äôt say.\\\\nWhat is a switching cost?\\\\nIt is the cost a customer has to pay when they decide to use another application. For example, when someone decided to use another SaaS app, the switching cost is loss of data. If they decide to play another game, they will end up losing all their progress and having to start from scratch.\\\\nEssentially, switching cost is a hidden cost that prevents a customer from using another app.\\\\nSince there is ‚ÄòZero Switching Costs‚Äô customer can have all of their competeitors on the phone and order from anyone of required. If they get one or two bad experiences, they might immediately jump to a competeitor.\\\\nIf BigBasket can also consistently deliver in under 15 minutes, Zepto is no longer a ‚Äòmust-have‚Äô but a ‚ÄòGood to have‚Äô.\\\\n6. 10 min model is replicable:\\\\nOne big IP risk is that their min model is incredible 10 in delivery can be implemented by anyone. All they need is some capital to frontload their darkstore and they‚Äôre good to go. To Retain customers in the long run, Zepto will have to keep providing on their promise of quick delivery.\\\\n7. Change in government regulations:\\\\nA lot of things need to go right for internet startups to succeed in India. Once such thing are the government regulations. As of now, Zepto can classify their drivers as partners and not employees. This allows them to pay their drivers like a consultant rather than an employee.\\\\nThis also includes all drivers who operate with Swiggy, Zomato and other delivery partners.\\\\nIf one day, the government mandates that they should also be treated as employees, it will mess with their entire P&L and might even sink the business.\\\\n8. Lose out on the waiting game\\\\nThe team behind is executing well, but can they maintain it for the long term. Old players like BigBasket are flush with an instream of capital from the TATA group. While Zepto is dependant on investor money to stay afloat. Sure, most of their darkstores eventually ramp up and start earning revenue.\\\\nBut what if players like BigBasket decide to cut Zepto on delivery costs & margins?\\\\nThis will be a long game where Zepto can only win if they are fiscally discipline and provide a stellar experience.\\\\nThese are some of the reasons we think Zepto might fail in the next 2 - 5 years.\\\\nHowever no one can predict the future and these are all just speculations up to this point. But as a growth and business person, it is your job to constantly speculate, hypothesise and play the devil‚Äôs advocate to future proof your business.\\\\nWe hope you enjoyed reading this blog.\\\\nüöÄ\\\\nIf you have any feedback, please do leave them in the TypeForm here. We want to make this blog 100X better for you, so we take all your feedback seriously!\\\\n                \\\\n                Contents\\\\nIntroduction\\\\nWhen I first heard about Zepto promising delivery in 10 minutes, I thought it was a marketing gimmick. But then I tried it. A fresh loaf of bread and some eggs arrived in less time than it took me to finish an email.\\\\nNaturally, I had to dig deeper into how they‚Äôre pulling this off.\\\\nThe answer?\\\\nDark stores.\\\\nWhat Are Dark Stores?\\\\nA dark store is essentially a warehouse designed for e-commerce fulfillment rather than walk-in customers. Unlike a traditional grocery store, dark stores prioritize efficiency, stocking fast-moving consumer goods in a hyper-organized way to minimize the time needed for picking and packing.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs dark stores are strategically located to ensure they‚Äôre within a 2-3 km radius of their target customers. This proximity reduces last-mile delivery time‚Äîa crucial factor in achieving their ambitious 10-minute promise.\\\\nThe Genesis of Zepto‚Äôs Dark Store Model\\\\nThe concept of dark stores is relatively new in India, but its roots can be traced back to successful implementations in developed countries.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs founders, Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, recognized an opportunity to adapt this model for the Indian market.\\\\nWith over 200-250 dark stores strategically located across major cities like Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru, and Chennai, Zepto has created a network that allows for rapid fulfillment of customer orders.\\\\nThese dark stores are designed to be efficient. The magic happens in less than 60 seconds from the moment an order is placed to when it is packed and ready for delivery. This is made possible through a combination of technology and human ingenuity.\\\\nEach store is equipped with a sophisticated inventory management system that ensures popular items are always in stock, allowing for swift picking and packing.\\\\nHow Dark Stores Work: The Math Behind the Magic\\\\nAt the heart of Zepto‚Äôs operations lies a well-oiled machine that combines logistics, technology, and customer insights. Here‚Äôs how it works:\\\\n- Strategic Location: Dark stores are placed within close proximity to high-demand neighborhoods. This ensures that the average delivery distance is approximately 1.8 km, significantly reducing travel time.\\\\n- Efficient Picking and Packing: Employees use handheld devices that guide them through the most efficient routes within the store to collect items quickly. The entire process‚Äîfrom picking to packing‚Äîtakes about 58 seconds, which is crucial for maintaining the 10-minute delivery promise.\\\\n- Real-Time Tracking: Once an order is packed, delivery personnel equipped with real-time tracking systems ensure that customers receive their groceries as quickly as possible. Zepto reports an average delivery time of 8 minutes and 47 seconds, which is impressive by any standard.\\\\nThe Financial Backbone: Cost Structure and Revenue\\\\nOperating dark stores does come with its challenges, particularly concerning cost management. According to Palicha, running a dark store typically costs about 5-10% of revenue, covering expenses like rent, utilities, and employee wages. This low overhead allows Zepto to maintain competitive pricing while still investing in expansion.\\\\nHowever, profitability remains a long-term goal rather than an immediate reality. While Zepto could achieve profitability by halting its expansion plans, the company is focused on growth‚Äîplanning to open more dark stores and expand its product offerings beyond groceries into categories like electronics and personal care products.\\\\nThe Customer Experience: A New Era of Convenience\\\\nFor consumers, Zepto represents a significant shift in how we shop for groceries. Gone are the days of planning ahead or making multiple trips to the store. With just a few taps on their smartphones, customers can have their essentials delivered within minutes.\\\\nThis convenience is particularly appealing in urban areas where traffic congestion can make traditional grocery shopping a hassle. By leveraging data analytics to understand consumer behavior, Zepto tailors its offerings to meet local demands‚Äîensuring that items popular in specific neighborhoods are readily available.\\\\nReal Calculations: The Impact of Dark Stores on Delivery Times\\\\nTo illustrate the efficiency of Zepto‚Äôs model with some real calculations:\\\\n- Average Delivery Distance: 1.8 km\\\\n- Average Delivery Time: 8 minutes 47 seconds\\\\n- Time Taken for Picking & Packing: 58 seconds\\\\nIf we break down the average delivery time:\\\\nAssuming an average speed of 15 km/h (which is reasonable for urban deliveries), it takes approximately:\\\\nDelivery Time = Distance/ Speed = 1.8 km/ 15 km h ‚âà 7.2 minutes\\\\nAdding picking and packing time:\\\\nTotal Time = 7.2 minutes + 0.97 minutes ‚âà 8.17 minutes\\\\nThis calculation aligns closely with their reported average delivery time of 8 minutes and 47 seconds, showcasing how efficiently they operate.\\\\nFuture Prospects: What Lies Ahead for Zepto?\\\\nAs I reflect on Zepto‚Äôs journey so far, it‚Äôs clear that they are not just another player in the grocery delivery space; they are setting new standards for what consumers can expect from quick commerce.\\\\nWith plans for further expansion and continuous optimization of its operations, Zepto aims to solidify its position as a leader in ultra-fast deliveries.\\\\nThere‚Äôs also talk of consolidation within the industry as competitors struggle with cash burn rates during this growth phase. However, as consumer demand for quick deliveries continues to rise, companies like Zepto may find themselves at an advantage due to their established infrastructure and brand recognition.\\\\nConclusion: A Revolution in Grocery Delivery\\\\nIn conclusion, Zepto‚Äôs dark store revolution exemplifies how innovation can reshape an industry. By focusing on operational efficiency, strategic location planning, and leveraging technology, they have created a compelling value proposition for consumers seeking convenience.\\\\nAs we move forward into an era where time is increasingly precious, companies like Zepto will likely continue to thrive‚Äîpushing boundaries and setting benchmarks that redefine our shopping experiences.\\\\nSo next time you find yourself waiting for your groceries to arrive at your doorstep within minutes‚Äîremember that behind this magic lies a meticulously crafted system designed to cater to your every need!\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto Business Model\\\\nIn recent years, Zepto has emerged as a game-changer in the online grocery delivery app industry, setting new standards with its ultra-fast delivery model.

Founded in 2020 by Kaivalya Vohra and Aadit Palicha, both Stanford University dropouts, Zepto has grown from an ambitious startup to one of the fastest-growing players in the Indian grocery delivery market. This is a closer look at Zepto\\\\\\'s remarkable journey, key milestones, and its vision for the future.\\\\nThe Genesis of Zepto\\\\nThe inspiration for Zepto emerged from a clear gap in the Indian grocery delivery market. Kaivalya and Aadit, who were classmates at Stanford, saw a significant inefficiency in how grocery deliveries were being handled. Traditional models of online grocery shopping were often bogged down by long wait times and supply chain delays, further exacerbated by traffic and logistical hurdles in urban areas. The duo envisioned a service that could promise lightning-fast deliveries, with an average delivery time ranging from just 10 to 30 minutes. This was a bold move, considering the scale and complexity of grocery logistics.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s business model was built around a hyperlocal approach, relying on strategically placed \"dark stores\" (mini warehouses) within cities. These stores were stocked with a carefully curated range of everyday essentials, enabling efficient deliveries to customers in close proximity. The target market was clear: urban, tech-savvy consumers who craved convenience and the flexibility to get fresh groceries at their doorstep in record time.\\\\nEarly Struggles and Strategic Development\\\\nLike most successful startups, Zepto\\\\\\'s journey wasn\\\\\\'t without challenges. The founders initially faced numerous obstacles in building the platform, especially in ensuring fast, reliable, and scalable delivery logistics. Unlike traditional e-commerce, where products can be stored in large warehouses and shipped globally, grocery deliveries had to be quick and localized to succeed. Zepto had to develop an innovative infrastructure and fine-tune its logistics from the ground up.\\\\nIn the early days, Zepto also faced stiff competition from established players such as BigBasket and Amazon Pantry and newer entrants like Swiggy Instamart. However, it was Zepto\\\\\\'s unique value proposition‚Äîits emphasis on speed and a personalized user experience‚Äîthat allowed it to differentiate itself from the competition.\\\\nKey Breakthroughs\\\\nThe years 2021 and 2022 marked significant breakthroughs for Zepto. With an initial seed round in hand, the startup raised additional funding to scale rapidly. A crucial moment in the company\\\\\\'s rise came when Zepto raised $60 million in a Series A funding round in 2021, which was followed by even larger investment rounds in 2022. These funds fuelled Zepto\\\\\\'s expansion into major metropolitan cities, including Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, and Chennai.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s model continued to evolve as it grew. The founders focused on optimizing supply chains, refining delivery processes, and using data analytics to predict demand more accurately. Zepto also invested heavily in technology, developing AI-driven solutions to streamline inventory management, delivery routes, and customer experience. This level of operational efficiency helped the company achieve faster deliveries, lower operational costs, and ultimately, higher profitability.\\\\nFunding Success and Valuation Surge\\\\nBy 2022, Zepto\\\\\\'s relentless pursuit of excellence and rapid expansion had paid off. In just two years, the company was able to raise multiple rounds of funding, reaching a valuation of approximately $900 million. The company attracted top investors, including Y Combinator, Nexus Venture Partners, and others. This impressive valuation placed Zepto among India\\\\\\'s most promising startups, setting the stage for future growth and innovation.\\\\nConsidering the growing demand for quick and reliable grocery deliveries, Zepto\\\\\\'s rapid rise to unicorn status (a valuation of over $1 billion) seemed almost inevitable. The company\\\\\\'s speed, operational excellence, and customer-centric approach positioned it as a serious contender in the Indian e-commerce space.\\\\nAdapting to Market Trends and Evolving Consumer Preferences\\\\nOne of the key reasons behind Zepto\\\\\\'s success is its ability to adapt to changing market trends and consumer preferences. As more consumers sought convenience and digital solutions in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Zepto quickly recognized and met this demand. It embraced cutting-edge technologies like AI, machine learning, and automation to fine-tune its processes. This allowed Zepto to predict consumer behavior more accurately, optimize its delivery routes in real-time, and ensure that customers received their orders as quickly as possible.\\\\nAdditionally, the company\\\\\\'s strong commitment to offering diverse products‚Äîfrom fresh fruits and vegetables to household staples‚Äîmeant that Zepto was not just another delivery service. It became a one-stop shop for busy city dwellers seeking to save time and avoid the hassle of traditional grocery shopping. Zepto\\\\\\'s partnerships with local suppliers ensured that products were fresh, affordable, and available when needed.\\\\nNavigating Competition and Strategic Partnerships (2023)\\\\nAs the market for hyperlocal deliveries grew more competitive, Zepto found itself facing formidable rivals such as Blinkit (formerly Grofers) and Swiggy Instamart. To maintain its competitive edge, Zepto doubled down on its strengths: speed, customer satisfaction, and strategic partnerships.\\\\nThe company continued to refine its supply chain, leveraging third-party logistics companies and forging new relationships with suppliers to secure exclusive product offerings. These partnerships helped Zepto maintain its promise of delivering groceries in minutes, even as its competitors worked to catch up.\\\\nZepto also invested in marketing and brand-building campaigns, establishing itself as a household name in India\\\\\\'s urban centers. The company\\\\\\'s aggressive expansion strategies allowed it to further strengthen its market position, tapping into Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, where demand for quick commerce was rising.\\\\nLooking Ahead: International Expansion and Future Growth\\\\nWhile Zepto remains intensely focused on consolidating its position in India, the company is laying the groundwork for future international expansion. Drawing inspiration from its success in India\\\\\\'s urban markets, Zepto aims to replicate its rapid-delivery model in other regions, including Southeast Asia and the Middle East, where similar consumer trends for convenience-driven e-commerce are emerging.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s future growth strategy also involves deepening its focus on sustainability and technology innovation. The company plans to explore electric vehicle fleets for deliveries, reduce its carbon footprint, and expand its tech capabilities to create a seamless, data-driven delivery experience. As the demand for instant gratification continues to grow, Zepto\\\\\\'s model is well-positioned to evolve and capture new opportunities.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nFrom its inception in 2020 to its remarkable growth in just a few short years, Zepto\\\\\\'s success story is one of vision, perseverance, and innovation. The company\\\\\\'s ability to combine speed, technology, and customer-centricity has transformed the Indian grocery delivery landscape. With its eyes set on international markets and continued technological innovation, Zepto is poised to become a global leader in the rapid-commerce space.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s journey is a testament to the power of understanding market needs, leveraging cutting-edge technology, and executing with precision.

Known for its ultra-fast 10-minute delivery model, Zepto has quickly risen to become one of the leaders in the quick commerce industry, all while building a strong brand presence. But what has driven its remarkable success?\\\\nLet‚Äôs take a closer look at Zepto‚Äôs marketing strategy and understand how this young startup became a force to be reckoned with in the competitive quick commerce landscape.\\\\nUnderstanding Zepto‚Äôs Marketing Mix\\\\nTo understand Zepto‚Äôs success, we need to break down its marketing mix. From the products it offers to its promotional tactics, every element plays a part in making Zepto a standout brand in the grocery delivery industry.\\\\n1. Product: A Promise of Speed and Convenience\\\\nZepto‚Äôs product offering revolves around the promise of convenience. The company delivers a wide variety of products ranging from groceries, fresh produce, household items, to personal care products‚Äîall in as little as 10 minutes. This ultra-fast delivery service has become the company‚Äôs hallmark, making it a go-to option for busy professionals, students, and families living in urban areas.\\\\nThe introduction of private-label products has also enhanced Zepto‚Äôs market appeal. By offering high-quality items at competitive prices, Zepto has not only captured customer interest but has also encouraged repeat business, thus fostering brand loyalty.\\\\n2. Price: Competitive Yet Sustainable\\\\nZepto‚Äôs pricing strategy is both competitive and sustainable. Unlike some competitors who rely heavily on deep discounts to attract customers, Zepto focuses on providing a value proposition that goes beyond pricing. The company offers attractive discounts and promotional offers, making it an appealing choice for budget-conscious consumers. However, the real game-changer is its focus on speed‚Äîsomething that traditional grocery delivery services don‚Äôt provide. This approach ensures that Zepto‚Äôs customers receive more than just low prices; they receive unparalleled service in terms of delivery speed.\\\\n3. Place: Convenience at Your Fingertips\\\\nZepto‚Äôs business model revolves around making grocery shopping as easy and efficient as possible for its customers. The platform operates primarily through a mobile app that enables users to place orders quickly and effortlessly. The app is designed with a user-friendly interface, catering to tech-savvy, time-conscious customers who value convenience.\\\\nZepto also uses a dark store model to ensure fast order fulfillment. These fulfillment centers, though not open to the public, are strategically located to facilitate swift deliveries. The dark store model allows Zepto to manage inventory efficiently and ensure that deliveries are completed in record time.\\\\n4. Promotion: Building a Strong Brand Identity\\\\nZepto‚Äôs promotional strategy is diverse and impactful, utilizing both traditional and digital channels to establish a strong brand presence. A key component of its promotional efforts is its focus on advertising and branding. Partnering with the advertising agency L&K Saatchi and Saatchi, Zepto created campaigns that emphasize its unique 10-minute delivery promise. The brand‚Äôs ads are designed to captivate and engage viewers by highlighting everyday situations where time is of the essence, ultimately showcasing how Zepto can solve this problem with its rapid delivery service.\\\\nAdditionally, Zepto has adopted social media meme marketing, a clever and engaging way to reach younger audiences. By creating memes around current events, pop culture, and trending topics, Zepto has been able to connect with its audience in a light-hearted, relatable manner. This not only helps the brand stay relevant but also builds a strong community around its product.\\\\nThe 10-Minute Delivery Strategy: A Game-Changer\\\\nWhen Zepto entered the market, it was not the first company to offer online grocery delivery. However, it was the first to promise deliveries in just 10 minutes‚Äîa unique selling point that set the brand apart from the competition. In the highly competitive world of quick commerce, speed is everything. Zepto‚Äôs 10-minute delivery service has proven to be its defining feature, allowing it to attract a loyal customer base.\\\\nAchieving such rapid delivery times is no easy feat. To fulfill its promise, Zepto relies on the dark store model, which enables efficient packing and dispatching of orders. Once a customer places an order, the system ensures that it is picked, packed, and dispatched within a minute. Zepto also uses advanced technology, including artificial intelligence, to streamline the entire process, from inventory management to delivery logistics. With an average delivery time of just 8 minutes and 47 seconds, Zepto is living up to its commitment of ultra-fast service.\\\\nAdvertising and Branding: Creating Buzz and Building Trust\\\\nZepto‚Äôs advertising strategy is another key factor that has contributed to its success. Through clever, engaging campaigns, the company has been able to capture the public‚Äôs attention and create a strong brand identity. One of its most successful campaigns featured the idea of waiting‚Äîsomething we all do in everyday life, whether it‚Äôs waiting in line at an airport or waiting for food at a restaurant. In the campaign, Zepto cleverly juxtaposes the frustration of waiting with its promise of 10-minute delivery, showing that while many things in life take time, Zepto‚Äôs service doesn‚Äôt.\\\\nBeyond traditional ads, Zepto also made waves with its innovative use of meme marketing. By leveraging the power of humor and social media trends, Zepto has created a relatable, fun brand that resonates with younger audiences. This approach not only garners attention but also promotes organic engagement, as users share Zepto‚Äôs memes across their networks.\\\\nCustomer Acquisition and Retention: Building Loyalty with Speed and Service\\\\nOne of the challenges for Zepto in such a competitive market was acquiring and retaining customers. While discounts and offers can attract new users, they don‚Äôt necessarily ensure long-term loyalty. Zepto, however, focuses on creating a unique experience that keeps customers coming back. The company‚Äôs commitment to ultra-fast delivery, combined with its excellent customer service, has led to impressive customer retention rates.\\\\nZepto also leverages referral programs to drive customer acquisition. The referral system rewards existing users for referring new customers, making it an effective strategy for growing its user base. By offering incentives for both the referrer and the referee, Zepto ensures that customers are motivated to spread the word about the service.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs Unique Selling Proposition (USP)\\\\nWhat truly sets Zepto apart from its competitors is its ability to deliver groceries in 10 minutes without compromising on the quality or price of the products. This quick delivery model, coupled with free shipping, offers customers a compelling reason to choose Zepto over other grocery delivery services, many of which charge for delivery. Zepto‚Äôs ability to maintain competitive prices while offering faster service has made it a preferred choice for urban dwellers.\\\\nConclusion: A Rising Star in Quick Commerce\\\\nZepto‚Äôs meteoric rise in the quick commerce industry is a testament to the power of innovation, speed, and smart marketing. By focusing on customer needs‚Äîspecifically, the desire for speed and convenience‚ÄîZepto has carved out a niche in a crowded market. With a combination of creative advertising, meme marketing, and an unbeatable delivery speed, Zepto has become the go-to app for time-conscious consumers.\\\\nIn a short time, Zepto has achieved what many of its competitors have struggled to do: build a loyal customer base, establish a strong brand identity, and deliver on its promises. As the quick commerce industry continues to grow, Zepto‚Äôs marketing strategies will likely serve as a blueprint for future startups looking to make an impact in the competitive world of online grocery delivery.\\\\nFAQs\\\\n1.

As a consequence of social distancing constraints, consumers are converting to online grocery shopping, which is not only convenient but also safer.\\\\nZepto - Founders and Team\\\\nAadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, both 19-year-old childhood pals, founded Zepto after walking out of Stanford University\\\\\\'s renowned computer science department to return to their home country, India, and start up a business. The Zepto company began its operations in April 2021.\\\\nKaivalya Vohra\\\\nKaivalya Vohra is the CTO and Co-Founder of Zepto. He was also the founder and CTO of KiranaKart. He also attended Stanford University to pursue a degree in Computer Science, but like Aadit, he decided to leave the university. Kaivalya, along with Aadit, participated in Y Combinator as well.\\\\nAadit Palicha\\\\nAadit Palicha is the CEO and Co-Founder of Zepto. He was also the founder and CEO of KiranaKart. After completing an IB diploma from GEMS Education in Mathematics and Computer Science, Palicha then went for a Bachelor\\\\\\'s degree in Computer Science from Stanford University, however, he quit the program in the middle to launch his firm. Aadit then completed Y Combinator Grade: W21 and started with PryvaSee as a Project Lead. Aadit Palicha then founded GoPool, his first startup, when he was just 17. He left the same in April 2020 and founded KiranaKart and then Zepto.\\\\nFlaunt your startup with StartupTalky\\\\n800+ stories, thousands of founders, and millions of visitors.

Inviting founders and startups who are building sustainable solutions from ground zero! Startups who run the show, StartupTalky will let the world know!\\\\nZepto - Startup Story\\\\nMany of us have \"startup ideas,\" but even the most creative among us struggle to see them through. Palicha and Vohra had both enrolled at Stanford to earn a Computer Science degree but had dropped out to follow their business passions instead.\\\\nThe story of Zepto started during the COVID-19 outbreak. The concept for Zepto sprang from the limitations of their houses. A surge in demand for delivery services meant that groceries and other necessities would arrive in a couple of days, creating a void for quick delivery. As a result, Zepto was created with all this insight.\\\\nThese teenagers were abruptly detained, because of Covid norms, detained in their Mumbai homes after significant collaboration on many projects, including a ride-hailing commuting app for kids. Even while grocery delivery, which was deemed important by local authorities, was still permitted across much of the nation as the virus spread, the duo battled to get their provisions as the illness expanded.\\\\nWhile Zepto is the focus of attention, Palicha and Vohra\\\\\\'s first venture, KiranaKart, did not receive the same acclaim. Zepto, on the other hand, is inspired by KiranaKart. KiranaKart, as its name implies, was a supermarket delivery service. It had made arrangements with Kirana merchants to provide groceries in 45 minutes or less. A $730,000 pre-seed round was led by Global Founders Capital, 2 AM Ventures, Contrary Capital, and angel investors. At the time, Vohra and Palicha planned to make the first 1.5 lakh deliveries for INR 1.\\\\nZepto - Mission and Vision\\\\nAs two bachelors living alone, the founders found it most difficult to obtain food, therefore, they focused their applications on grocery delivery. So, whereas KiranaKart, their first startup, tried to make grocery delivery easier for Kiranas, Zepto aims to shorten delivery times.\\\\nZepto - Name, Logo, and Tagline\\\\nThe firm, which uses the term \"Zepto\" to denote \"a factor of 10‚Åª¬≤¬π, i.e. 0.000000000000000000001,\" named after a minuscule unit of time, offers a 10-minute grocery delivery service, surpassing numerous well-funded competitors.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s tagline says, \"Groceries delivered in 10 minutes\".\\\\nZepto - Business and Revenue Model\\\\nZepto delivers groceries in ten minutes through a system of dark storefronts and mini-warehouses, on up to 90% of orders. Zepto works in the quick commerce segment of India. It is designed to be customer-centric and built around the instant service model.\\\\nTo ensure a flawless delivery experience, Aadit says that their average delivery time is 8 minutes and 47 seconds. Through a chain of dark stores or retail distribution centers, the Mumbai-based company employs a hotspot method to cater largely to digital purchases.\\\\nA dark store is a tiny neighborhood storehouse that customers cannot visit but purchase online to get packaged delivery. While dark stores are not new to the Indian industry, Aadit believes that the idea has yet to be completely explored. Population, traffic dynamics, topography, road patterns, weather conditions, last-mile operational improvement, real estate prices, and other geographic data and local intelligence aid Zepto in optimizing its connectivity. Furthermore, the startup\\\\\\'s dark warehouses and cool rooms are custom-designed to satisfy particular criteria such as ease of travel, allowing packers to move as swiftly as possible to fill orders.\\\\nLocation intelligence and geographic data, such as topography, population, road patterns, traffic dynamics, weather, last-mile supply availability, real estate values, and so on, are said to help Zepto optimize its network.\\\\nZepto - Funding and Investors\\\\nZepto, the Mumbai-based quick commerce unicorn, achieved unicorn status in August 2023 after raising $200 million in a Series E funding round, which brought its valuation to $1.4 billion. This milestone marked the end of India\\\\\\'s 11-month unicorn drought. The Series E round was led by The StepStone Group, with participation from Goodwater Capital and existing investors.\\\\nIn June 2024, Zepto raised $665 million, which valued the company at $3.6 billion. Just a few months later, on August 30, 2024, Zepto raised $340 million in Series G funding, which increased its valuation to $5 billion. The Series G round was led by General Catalyst, with Dragon Fund and Epiq Capital joining as new investors. Existing backers such as StepStone, Lightspeed, DST, and Contrary also increased their investments, reflecting strong confidence in Zepto\\\\\\'s growth potential.\\\\nIn November 2024, Zepto raised another $350 million from a group of domestic investors, led by Motilal Oswal\\\\\\'s private wealth division, at a flat valuation of $5 billion. This brings the total funding raised by Zepto to $2 billion.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s initial seed funding in September 2020 was led by Contrary.\\\\n| Date | Round | Amount | Lead Investors |\\\\n|---|---|---|---|\\\\n| November 21, 2024 | Series G | $350 | Motilal Oswal Wealth |\\\\n| August 30, 2024 | Series G | $340 million | General Catalyst, Mars Growth Capital |\\\\n| June 21, 2024 | Series F | $665 million | Glade Brook Capital Partners, Nexus Venture Partners, StepStone Group |\\\\n| Nov 8, 2023 | Series E | $31.3 million | Goodwater Capital, Nexus Venture Partners |\\\\n| Aug 25, 2023 | Series E | $200 million | StepStone Group |\\\\n| May 2, 2022 | Series D | $200 million | Y Combinator Continuity Fund |\\\\n| Dec 20, 2021 | Series C | $100 million | Y Combinator Continuity Fund |\\\\n| Oct 31, 2021 | Series B | $60 million | Glade Brook Capital Partners |\\\\n| Mar 22, 2021 | Series A | $6.5 million | Nexus Venture Partners |\\\\n| Sep 1, 2020 | Pre Seed Round | - | Contrary |\\\\nZepto - Shareholding\\\\nZepto shareholding pattern as of October 2024 (source: Tracxn):\\\\n| Zepto Shareholders | Percentage |\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n| Aadit Palicha | 0.9% |\\\\n| Kaivalya Vohra | 0.7% |\\\\n| Nexus Venture Partners | 18.6% |\\\\n| Glade Brook Capital | 10.3% |\\\\n| StepStone Group | 9.8% |\\\\n| Y Combinator | 8.7% |\\\\n| LGF Scale I | 7.8% |\\\\n| Rocket Internet | 3.0% |\\\\n| General Catalyst | 4.1% |\\\\n| Goodwater Capital | 1.8% |\\\\n| Razor\\\\\\'s Edge Ventures | 1.6% |\\\\n| Contrary | 1.6% |\\\\n| Kaiser Permanente | 2.3% |\\\\n| avra | 1.3% |\\\\n| SpringBlue Capital | 1.0% |\\\\n| Lightspeed Venture Partners | 0.8% |\\\\n| Global Founders Capital | 0.8% |\\\\n| Crimson | 0.5% |\\\\n| Vanderbilt University | 0.3% |\\\\n| Mangum | 0.3% |\\\\n| Bayhouse Capital | 0.2% |\\\\n| Mehta Ventures | <0.1% |\\\\n| Contrary Capital | <0.1% |\\\\n| Zpt Holdings | 2.1% |\\\\n| AZ04 | 1.4% |\\\\n| Kiranakart SPV | 0.6% |\\\\n| Sayacorps | 0.4% |\\\\n| C Opportunities | 0.1% |\\\\n| Jung Lish Lee | 2.3% |\\\\n| Oliver Jung | 0.7% |\\\\n| Oleg Wladimir Nicolas Tscheltzoff | 0.2% |\\\\n| Aditi Javesh Jhaveri | <0.1% |\\\\n| Manoj Chawla | <0.1% |\\\\n| Kavit Dilip Palicha | 8.0% |\\\\n| Jaideep Vohra | 6.7% |\\\\n| Other Investors | 1.0% |\\\\nAmong the shareholders, Nexus Venture Partners holds the largest stake, holding 18.6% of Zepto. Other prominent owners of Zepto include Y Combinator, Glade Brook Capital, StepStone Group, and co-founders Aadit Palicha (along with Kavit Dilip Palicha) and Kaivalya Vohra (along with Jaideep Vohra), among others.\\\\nZepto - IPO\\\\nZepto plans to go public in 2025. To prepare for its IPO, the company set up a new entity, Zepto Marketplace Private Limited, in October 2024 to simplify its operations. Zepto currently operates under a B2B model, sourcing products directly from brands and selling them to its partner companies, which then distribute the products to customers under a licensing agreement.\\\\nIn January 2025, Zepto completed its domicile shift from Singapore to India ahead of its IPO, which is now expected to raise between $800 million and $1 billion, including secondaries. Initially, the company targeted a $450 million primary capital raise.\\\\nZepto has hired Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Axis Capital as advisors for the IPO. This marks a key step in its journey as a leader in the quick commerce industry.\\\\nZepto - Growth and Revenue\\\\nZepto has seen impressive growth, serving 10 major cities with 1,000+ employees. They deliver more than 5,000 products, revolutionizing the Indian grocery segment with 10-minute delivery, advanced tech, and optimized centers.\\\\nEngineering, operations, marketing, and financial positions are also available at Zepto. Palicha claims that month-over-month growth is 200%, with a monthly retention rate of 78%.\\\\n‚ÄúWe are looking at a pretty crazy runrate,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn the past one and a half months, we have grown our business by 10 times. And now we are working to grow another 10 times by February or March,‚Äù said Palicha in December 2021.\\\\nZepto, when it was a five-month-old startup, had secured a valuation of $570 million after raising $100 million in a Series C round headed by Y Combinator\\\\\\'s Continuity Fund, which was a 2X increase from its previous valuation of $60 million only 45 days before that. Zepto raised another round led by Y Combinator to lift its valuation further to $900 million, so there is certainly impressive growth that the company has received in funding as well.\\\\nAnother positive development for Zepto has been the expertise it has been able to acquire. Plenty of well-known senior executives from Uber, Flipkart, Dream11, Amazon, and Pharmeasy have joined the team.\\\\nAccording to Palicha, one of the reasons why several entrepreneurs have chosen Zepto is that it has enabled individuals who had transferred from Mumbai to Bangalore to come back to their homes. He says, nevertheless, that the startup\\\\\\'s rapid development, rigorous execution, and ambitions have captivated others who share his interests. \"We\\\\\\'ve been able to walk the walk,\" he said.\\\\n‚ÄúThey originally launched with a different model, swiftly pivoted to quick commerce in August 2021 and are now adding 100,000 new customers every week, 60% of them women. Their attention to detail on the logistics experience is unparalleled and this has enabled them to scale to most major metros in just 5 months. Simply put, we‚Äôre confident Zepto will win in this space over the long-term,\" said Anu Hariharan, a partner at Y Combinator, in a statement.\\\\nZepto has demonstrated significant growth in recent times, with the majority of its dark stores now operating profitably. According to co-founder and CEO Aadit Palicha, Zepto has successfully established its presence in major metro cities in India with over 300-400 dark stores. Impressively, approximately 50‚Äì60 percent of these dark stores have started generating cash flows, indicating the effectiveness of Zepto\\\\\\'s business model and operational strategies. This noteworthy achievement highlights Zepto\\\\\\'s commitment to sustainable growth and profitability in the fiercely competitive quick-commerce industry.\\\\nZepto Financials\\\\n| Zepto Financials | FY22 | FY23 | FY24 |\\\\n|---|---|---|---|\\\\n| Operating Revenue | INR 142.3 crore | INR 2,026 crore | INR 4,454 crore |\\\\n| Expenses | INR 532.7 crore | INR 3,350 crore | INR 5,754 crore |\\\\n| Profit/Loss | INR 390.3 crore (loss) | INR 1,272 crore (loss) | INR 1,248 crore (loss) |\\\\nIn FY23, the quick-commerce startup‚Äôs operating revenue stood at INR 2,026 crore.

The company also reported a 140% year-on-year growth, with 75% of its dark stores achieving full EBITDA positivity by May 2024.\\\\nZepto - Challenges\\\\nZepto has encountered some challenges lately, and in one of the recent ones, there were instances of founder and investor impropriety within the quick commerce delivery startup. Ansh Nanda, an alleged co-founder of the startup said that he was forced to relinquish his stakes in the startup by the other cofounders and by Nexus Ventures. This was carried forward by Nanda, who lodged an FIR against the cofounders of Zepto and the Nexus Ventures partner, Suvir Sujan. However, the co-founders responded to the same without much delay by approaching the Delhi High Court. Zepto is the third startup that is backed by Nexus and where one of the co-founders has been named in an FIR. YoloBus and Acko were two other companies that dealt with the same before.\\\\nZepto - Advertisements and Social Media Campaigns\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s marketing strategy has been a key driver of its rapid growth in the quick-commerce industry. The creative brilliance of L&K Saatchi & Saatchi was evident in three earlier ads promoting Zepto\\\\\\'s products and services.\\\\nBuilding on this success, Zepto continued to impress with new campaigns featuring celebrated singers like Kailash Kher, Shankar Mahadevan, and Usha Uthup during the IPL season of 2022. These unique and melodic campaigns resonated with audiences, boosting Zepto\\\\\\'s visibility and brand appeal.\\\\nFurthermore, the launch of the \"Nahi Milega\" campaign in March 2023, featuring the character \"Uncle Ji,\" highlighted unlimited free deliveries, solidifying Zepto\\\\\\'s position as the go-to platform for ultra-fast and cost-effective grocery delivery. With an innovative approach and successful marketing initiatives, Zepto has emerged as a leading player in the competitive quick-commerce industry, catering to the needs of time-conscious consumers.\\\\nZepto - Competitors\\\\nMany businesses compete with Zepto and have already been driving fast-paced delivery of groceries like:\\\\n- Swiggy Instamart\\\\n- Blinkit\\\\n- Big Basket\\\\nDunzo is another startup, that uses its Xpress Mart dark shop network to deliver groceries in Bengaluru in 19 minutes and competes with Zepto.\\\\nZepto - Future Plans\\\\nZepto currently operates in major cities across India, including Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Ghaziabad, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, and Kolkata. The company has ambitious plans to multiply its dark stores and expand its delivery network with profitability in focus.\\\\nZepto has sped up its store expansion, increasing its target from 700 to 1,200 stores by March 2025.

This case study explores the factors that have contributed to Zepto‚Äôs success in the quick commerce industry.\\\\nZepto was founded in 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, a time when the demand for home delivery services surged due to lockdowns and social distancing norms. The founders, recognizing the potential in quick commerce, envisioned a platform that could deliver groceries and essentials faster than traditional e-commerce giants. Their vision was to combine technology, operational efficiency, and customer-centric services to redefine the grocery shopping experience.\\\\nAadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, the young and dynamic entrepreneurs behind Zepto, brought fresh perspectives and innovative ideas to the table.

What is Zepto‚Äôs Business Model?\\\\nThere‚Äôs both a simple and a complex way of introducing Zepto‚Äôs Business Model.\\\\nIn simple words - You order groceries from Zepto and they deliver it to your location. They make money out of this process.\\\\nLet‚Äôs say that you have some visitors home. You want some sweets and a packet of chips to serve your guests. So you would go to Zepto, choose all the items you want to order, pay for it and get it in under 10 minutes.\\\\nBut here‚Äôs everything Zepto has to do to get those product to your home in under 10 mins ‚è¨\\\\nRent a warehouse and assemble their dark store\\\\nHire delivery executives to deliver your order\\\\nHire folks to handle all the packing, arranging & all other operational tasks inside the warehouse\\\\nHire folks to handle support when things don‚Äôt go as planned\\\\nSpeak to local suppliers to get the groceries and other supplies to their dark store\\\\nBuild an app to display all the items for the customers\\\\nSpeak to UPI aggregators, banks & other financial institutions to setup seamless payment systems for you\\\\nBuild in-house systems to communicate your order to the operational staff\\\\nBuild in-house systems to help the delivery executive pickup orders and deliver them safely\\\\n& so much more‚Ä¶.\\\\nWhatever you see on your smartphone is only possible because of a ton of moving parts that seem to be seamlessly fixed with each other. This is the very simple answer to Zepto‚Äôs Business Model ü§üüèº\\\\nTo understand the complex version of Zepto‚Äôs business model, you can jump to the relevant section using the quick links below\\\\nTo breakdown this craziness behind the 10 min delivery, our team downloaded Zepto and made a quick order. We made sure that the order contained a mix of meat, fruits & milk (their highest margin items). Zepto delivered this order in less than 13 minutes!\\\\nWe also looked at a ton of user interviews and founder interviews on YouTube to understand the Zepto business model in depth.\\\\nEverything you see here is a result of mix of original research gathered from the internet and the users of Zepto. Here are the 5 key pieces that allow Zepto to deliver your order in 10 minutes or less!\\\\n1. Darkstores & Microwarehouses:\\\\nDarkstores are physical warehouses where all the items you see on the Zepto app are placed in. When you order anything, a Zepto delivery executive picks up all your items from one of these dark stores and brings it to you.\\\\nUnlike traditional retail stores, you cannot go to a dark store and buy your grocery items. Dark stores can only be accessed by Zepto‚Äôs team members and their vendors.\\\\nDark stores are the sole reason why Zepto is able to deliver some orders in under 10 minutes. By being in close proximity to a dense urban are, they are able to deliver your order quickly.\\\\nFor example, let‚Äôs consider Indiranagar in Bangalore.\\\\nBy placing a warehouse in this location, Zepto will be able to service all these neighbourhoods in under 10 minutes.\\\\nIf the order frequency and retention is good, the dark stores will max out almost instantly. Then they could either add more deliver partners to the same dark store or simplu open up one more dark store nearby!\\\\nWhat happens if that dark store also reaches a bottleneck?\\\\nIn that case, Zepto opens up another dark store to meet demands.\\\\nBut thanks to their experienced leadership team, all these expansion decisions are backed by data. They take into account geography, future growth potential, traffic, weather, driver availability & much more before they even think about opening a new dark store.\\\\n2. Super Quick Packaging\\\\nThe founding principles of Zepto has always been impeccable operations backed by custom built software. That‚Äôs how they scaled their first store and that‚Äôs the same principle they‚Äôre using for all their stores across India.\\\\nOnce you place an order, an operations executive inside their warehouse will get two things\\\\nA list of all the items in your orders\\\\nA map to navigate themselves inside the warehouse to pickup all the items in the least amount of time\\\\nThe second point is what truly allows Zepto to become a kingpin on operational efficiency üöÄ. As their CTO Kaivalya Arora says, ‚ÄòWe have designed the process to make sure the entire order is dispacted in 60 - 90 seconds‚Äô\\\\nThis means that the rest of the time is entirely spent on the last mile delivery, thereby easing some pressure on the delivery partner.\\\\nThis brings us onto our third point\\\\n3. Internal Structure of the warehouses\\\\nOperational efficiency is the name of the game when it comes to any operations heavy business. And Zepto achieves operational efficiency in a class of its own üßóüèº‚ôÄÔ∏è.\\\\nThe operations have streamlined the entire warehouse with a data led approach. They‚Äôve looked at the items which move the quickest and have placed it closer to the entrance. Groceries which are not frequenlty ordered are de-prioritised and placed at the back.\\\\nThe creative below will give you an idea of how a darkstore might be structured based on the order frequency of different items. Although this structure is just an example and is subject to change based on several other factors.\\\\nBut Multiply this structural formula with item size, refrigeration needs, fragility & you will get a repeatable model of how to design all your warehouses at scale üöÄ\\\\nFor example, fruits & vegetables are one of their most important and highest margin categories. Hence they have decided to place them in shelves closer to the entrance, where they‚Äôre very easy grab and place into delivery bags.\\\\nTo draw parallels, this is very similar to how the founders of McDonalds designed their Kitchen to complete customer orders in less than two minutes ü§Ø\\\\nIf you haven‚Äôt seen ‚ÄòThe Founder‚Äô on Netflix, this is an open call to see it ASAP. If you‚Äôre working in an operations heavy business or interested in building one, please remember that operational efficiency is crucial for your long term success.\\\\nBut, how do you design superfast systems even when human decisions are part of the system?\\\\nA human operator has to look at the order and decide the chronological order of items in the delivery bag. This takes time and there is also the risk of human errors. Items might be missed or fragile items might end up getting placed at the bottom of the bag (No one likes to have their eggs & tomatoes crushed under a watermelon ‚òπÔ∏è)\\\\nSo the team came up with a pretty simple solution - Give a tablet like device to each operations executive in the darkstore. It works like a Google map, guiding the executive to pickup the items placed in the warehouse.\\\\nOnce the operator is assigned an order, they are told where and how to pick each item in a chronological order.\\\\nTheir CTO Kaivalya says ‚ÄúWe wanted to remove human decisions as much as possible. So each of our executives have a handheld software device driving them through the most optimal pathway‚Äù\\\\nThis system works like a charm and has allowed them to exponentially open new dark stores across India üöÄ, while maintaining quality control.\\\\n4. Incredibly short distances to delivery:\\\\nBigBasket took anywhere between 3 hours to a day to deliver a bag of groceries, while Zepto does it in 10 minutes. A lot of this speed is heavily owed to a warehouse that is present in close proximity to an urban location. This is just simple physics bringing down the time of the last mile delivery.\\\\nSince the distances are closer, the delivery executives are also able to fulfill their orders quicker. Moreover with customers who order frequently, Zepto can assign the same set of delivery partners to fullfil their orders. Since they are well acquainted with the location of the customers, this brings the Time To Deliver even lower üëçüèº.\\\\n5. Driver‚Äôs Familiarity with their locality:\\\\nThe operations team at Swiggy use incredibly sophisticated Machine Learning models to bring down the total deliver time. Right from choosing which partner gets which order to how many order each partner picks up.\\\\nThis allows the delivery partner to\\\\nPickup multiple order and deliver them on the way\\\\nDeliver one order and pickup an order from a nearby hotel\\\\nTo even give you a rough estimation, Swiggy has to calculate four things before assigning a delivery partner to your order.\\\\nThis gets more complex when the delivery executive has to pickup one more order or has to deliver one more order on the way to your house.\\\\nIf you thought that was complex, think about assigning a delivery partner at random. Sometimes they might be familiar with your area. Sometimes they might not be familiar with your locality. Now combine this with traffic and other humane errors!\\\\nWith Zepto, some of these problems like Prep Time are naturally removed due to the nature of the business. Since the drivers are also operating in a familiar locality, the first mile & last mile times are brought down significantly.\\\\nHere‚Äôs how the Zepto would calculate time for a delivery partner who‚Äôs already at the darkstore\\\\nThe human factor is definitely one of the bigger advantages of Zepto. In a matter of weeks, the delivery partners become familiar with each road and each shortcut. Familiarity breeds speed and the delivery partners get quick with time.\\\\nIf you‚Äôre interested about how Swiggy does their driver routing, please do give this and this a read üëçüèº\\\\n2. How does Zepto make money üí∏?\\\\nWe‚Äôve seen how Zepto operates from a micro and a macro view. They store groceries in a darkstore and deliver them with the help of their delivery partners. But all this seems like a costly affair to run. They have to pay rent for each darkstore, salaries for darkstore operators & payments for delivery partners. These are fixed operating costs to Zepto.\\\\nAdd this on top of the tech, product & marketing costs, it‚Äôll give you a fair idea of the amount of money required to keep Zepto alive. So how does Zepto earn money selling groceries?\\\\nHere are the five ways they are currently earning money ü§ë, along with one potential way Zepto they can earn money in the future üöÄ\\\\n1. Margins on each individual product:\\\\nThe most common way grocery delivery startups earn money is on the margins of each individual product. This model is similar to the retailers who buy goods at a lower cost from distributors and sell it at a higher price ‚úÖ\\\\nFor example, let‚Äôs assume that Zepto sells a kg of onion for a price of 24 rupees. They earn margins on this by buying a large quantity from a distributor at a lower price.\\\\nWe went to the internet and checked for prices of onions from distributors. The prices range from anywhere between 10 rupees/ kg to 20 rupees/ kg.\\\\nIf they are able to tie up with a buyer at the lowest price, this is definitely a win win for both of them. Because Zepto gets onion at a lower price and the distributor also gets his order fulfilled almost frequently leading to repeatable revenue numbers.\\\\nFor starters we did some calculations as to how much revenue Zepto could earn from just one warehouse and from onion üß†\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume that Zepto orders 100 kg of onion for one of its warehouses in Bandra every day.\\\\nThe price of one kilogram of onion comes around to 10 rupees.\\\\nSo let‚Äôs assume that the total cost to Zepto along with transportation is 1200 rupees.\\\\nLet‚Äôs also assume an ideal state where they are able to sell the entire 100 kg over the same day.\\\\nWe know that zepto currently sells onion at a price of 24 rupees/ kg.\\\\nNow that‚Äôs 2400 rupees before taxes & other charges.\\\\nNot bad for 100 kgs of onion sold in just one darkstore.\\\\nAccording to their CTO, Kaivalya -‚ÄùPotatoes, Onion, Tomatoes are some of our highest selling items on Zepto. Fruits & vegetables also happen to be one of the highest margin items on our platform‚Äù\\\\nOnion is just one category here. One look into Zepto and you‚Äôll see hundreds of vegetables, fruits, and quick perishable items, all of which are high margin items on Zepto!\\\\n2. Handling Charges\\\\nHandling charge is the fee collected by Zepto to organise, pack and dispatch the items on your list. We clicked on the ‚Äòinformation‚Äô button to understand more about this handling charge and we were thrown the following message - ‚ÄúHandling charge is levied to ensure the products are handled, packed & dispatched safely‚Äù\\\\nWe tried to see if a handling charge is levied by all grocery delivery platforms in India\\\\nSwiggy Instamart - Yes, they had a handling charge\\\\nBigBasket NOW - They had something called a delivery token, but it seemed very similar to this handling charge\\\\nBlinkit - Surprisingly, they did not have a handling charge\\\\nWe figured that the handling charge was not a set standard across all grocery delivery platforms. So this is something that is levied by platforms in different ways.\\\\n3. Delivery Charges\\\\nThis is the second bigger piece of solving the profitability equation for most delivery grocery startups. Delivery charge is a big incredibly important for solving profitability because\\\\nNo matter the size of the order, Zepto has to pay the same delivery fee to their delivery partner\\\\nBut high delivery charges can also be a reason why users stop buying from Zepto\\\\nThe key here is to find the balance between waiving delivery charges and growing profitably üí™üèº. Zepto has solved this problem by choosing to charge customers for orders with a low value basket size. However if you break a certain threshold, you‚Äôll unlock the option to get a ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô\\\\nIncreasing the threshold to unlock free delivery does two things\\\\nIncreases the AOV of each order by encouraging customer to order more\\\\nImprove revenue by charging delivery fee on orders with low AOV\\\\nThe net benefit is aimed at increasing overall revenue from the ‚Äòdelivery fee‚Äô lever. But it might also reduce the overall order frequency for certain ICPs who are Power users. High delivery fees might discourage users who use Zepto to order everything at the last minute.\\\\nHence this a profit lever the ‚ÄòGrowth Team‚Äô must constantly tweak and experiment with data!\\\\nBut the fact is that people are tier 1 cities are increasingly favouring CONVENIENCE >>> MONEY. Our hypothesis is that most folks won‚Äôt mind paying a delivery fee of 25 - 50 get their order delivered.\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume that Sheila orders from Zepto 6 times a week\\\\n‚Üí Even if she gets 3 free deliveries a week, we still have 3 deliveries where Zepto earns a revenue\\\\n‚Üí If she‚Äôs paying 35/ delivery, that‚Äôs 105 rupees for a week.\\\\n‚Üí Extrapolate that across a month and Zepto has earned a revenue of 420 rupees.\\\\n‚Üí Assuming there are 100 customers like her in one dark store, Zepto has just earned 42,000 rupees just from deliveries.\\\\nYou should note that these these numbers are highly speculative and can vary a lot. But you get the gist. Done right, Zepto can find a balance between earning from delivery charges while also maintaining the user frequency ü´Ç\\\\nOne interesting fact to note that if your order is less than 50 rupees, Zepto levies a fee of ‚ÄòSmall Cart Fee‚Äô of Rupees 35. This will incentivise the user to add more to their cart quite naturally!\\\\n4. Product Customisations:\\\\nUser Research is something we push actively in the GrowthX experience. Before you hypothesize any solution, you should always seek to understand your users and their problems.\\\\nIn Zepto‚Äôs case, it‚Äôs safe to say that they‚Äôve identified their customers and their problems incredibly well. One good example is under their fruits and vegetables section\\\\nRight from peeled onion, to cut carrots & loose corn. They have identified ways to take existing vegetables, customize them and increase their prices üöÄ\\\\nFor example:\\\\n500 grams of carrot costs 45 rupees.\\\\nBringing it down to 100 grams this costs just 9 rupees.\\\\nBut 200 grams of peeled carrots costs 53 rupees on Zepto.\\\\nBringing this down to 100 grams costs a whopping 26 rupees\\\\nBy simply washing and cutting up the carrots, they have found ways to increase their margins on their products.\\\\nSimple economics shows a 300% increase in price ü§Ø just by customising the product a bit.\\\\nSure you‚Äôll have to buy expensive machinery or employ people to help with these customisation. But if Zepto is able to achieve good volumes, this cost will also go down as it‚Äôs fixed!\\\\nZepto definitely nailed ‚ÄòPeople don‚Äôt buy your product, they buy the solution that can be achieved with your product‚Äô ü§òüèº\\\\n5. Product Ads:\\\\nProduct Ads are a proven way to earn predictable revenue in most e-commerce and marketplace businesses. Zepto also pulls this off Product Ads in a flawless manner\\\\nAlmost everyone in the grocery space uses product ads as a monetary lever.\\\\nThe concept is simple: If you‚Äôre a retailer, you can give money to Zepto to feature your products at the top of certain searches & categories.\\\\nFor example, Bru features their ‚ÄòBru Instant Pure Coffee Jar‚Äô at the first position for the keyword ‚Äòcoffee.\\\\n6. Membership:\\\\nThis is a model Zepto hasn‚Äôt experimented yet, but proves to a very solid model for predictable revenue growth. Swiggy has already rolled out this membership model in the name of ‚ÄòSwiggy One‚Äô.\\\\nBy subscribing to their membership, you can get\\\\nFree deliveries on all orders\\\\nNo surge fees\\\\nBetter discounts\\\\nOther ecommerce startups also have similar models like\\\\nAmazon‚Äôs ‚ÄòAmazon Prime‚Äô,\\\\nFlipkart‚Äôs ‚ÄòFlipkart Plus‚Äô &\\\\nMeesho‚Äôs upcoming membership model.\\\\nThe membership will model will allow Zepto to predict how their revenue will grow with certainty. It can also be beneficial since it increase customer retention and serves as a good moat!\\\\nWe will have to wait and see if Zepto also rolls out this feature in the future!\\\\nüí°\\\\nBy the way, the depth you see here is just a feeler of the depth we teach at GrowthX üí´\\\\nGrowthX is an invite-only club of over 3000 members who are product, marketing, and business leaders, and founders from top internet-first companies like Google, Canva, CRED, Stripe, Netflix, and more üíé\\\\nWe teach our members how to scale revenues via frameworks that can be applied starting next Monday morning.

So you go to Zepto and order for some fresh ID dosa batter\\\\nYou are preparing lunch when you realise that you don‚Äôt have any onions left for dinner. Maybe you order some onions along with a fresh set of groceries for the next three days\\\\nYou feel the need to snack and want some biscuits and chips. So you go to Zepto to order some snacks along with essential groceries for the week\\\\nYou step into the washroom to brush your teeth, only to realise you are out of paste. You quickly open Zepto and get some paste delivered in the next 10 minutes\\\\nThese are just a tiny subset of the use cases of Zepto. Also most of these examples were just around groceries. Zepto also has a ton of other sub categories like\\\\nCleaning Essentials\\\\nMakeup items\\\\nBaby care\\\\nBath & Body care\\\\nElectricals & Accessories\\\\n& much more\\\\nA simple probability check will show you that the use cases are in the thousands (and growing as Zepto plans to add new categories ü§òüèº). Before you build any growth strategy, you need to find a way to bucket these millions of users & use cases into something consumable.\\\\nThis look into Zepto‚Äôs ideal customer is nothing perfect. But it will give you a solid foundation into Zepto‚Äôs primary users.\\\\nWe have borrowed these insights from the assignment submitted by one of our members - Aadeesh Deshpande (GX12). He is currently working as Associate Director - Business Development and Key Accounts at MX Player.

This table is nowhere close to perfect. We‚Äôre sure that the growth team inside Zepto will have more data points on this.\\\\nBut this table gives you a basic overview into\\\\nWho are buying from Zepto?\\\\nWhy are they buying from Zepto?\\\\nWhat are they buying from Zepto?\\\\nAnd their major blockers to spend more on Zepto\\\\nWith these characteristics in mind, let‚Äôs take a peek into the market sizing of Zepto üëáüèº\\\\n2. Understanding the market (TAM, SAM, SOM)\\\\nIn an interview with Master‚Äôs Union, their CTO Kaivalya Arora says ‚Äúwe went from 5 to 77+ dark stores from Sep to Dec, 2022‚Äù\\\\nThis massive growth is backed by some of the top investors in the market like Nexus, Glade Brook & YCombinator. This is even after there are tons of grocery startups in the market like Instamart, Blinkit and let‚Äôs not forget Tata‚Äôs BigBasket!\\\\nThis is possible because of the nature & scale of the grocery business in India üáÆüá≥\\\\nTheir CEO points the scale of the grocery & essential industry in a beautiful way - ‚ÄúDmart has built a $40 Billion dollar business in a matter of 20 years. If we can even capture a portion of that volume, we can build a profitable business effectively‚Äù\\\\nSo the question is\\\\n‚ùì\\\\nHow big is the grocery market and how much market share is available for Zepto?\\\\nIndia is a massive country with a total population of 1.5 billion people ü§Ø\\\\nBut Zepto cannot cater to this entire base as most of them are located in Tier 2+ cities & rural areas. Maybe Zepto will tap everyone in India (in the future) or maybe we‚Äôll have a Tier 2+ focused startup like Meesho focusing on just that market!\\\\nBut for the foreseeable future, Zepto will only be focusing on the folks living in Tier1+ cities with Annual salaries greater than 10 lakh/ annum\\\\nKartik Narang (GX10), a fellow GrowthX member and Capabilities & Insights Analyst McKinsey laid out this TAM calculation in an incredible manner in one of his acquisition assignmentsüöÄ\\\\nCondition\\\\nCalculation\\\\nTotal Population in Tier 1 Cities in India\\\\n70 Million\\\\nPercentage of People between 20 & 40 years of age\\\\n40%\\\\nTotal Population in Tier 1 cities between the age of 20 - 40\\\\n28 Million\\\\nPercentage of Annual Income greater than 10 lakhs\\\\n40%\\\\nTotal Population in Tier 1 cities between the age 20 - 40 with Annual Income greater than 10 lakhs\\\\n11.2 Million\\\\nAverage number of people per household\\\\n4\\\\nTotal Number of houses that can be reached\\\\n11.2/ 4 ‚áí 3 Million households\\\\n„Ö§\\\\n„Ö§\\\\nThe total TAM in terms of the number of households can be assumed anywhere between 3 to 7 million based on the variations in the following categories\\\\nSwati Poddar (GX9), another fellow GrowthX member and PM at Walmart has smartly converted this into revenue numbers by multiplying the TAM with the average spend on groceries for each household. This was also an acquisition assignment as part of the GrowthX learning experience.\\\\nüí°\\\\nBy the way, the depth you see here is just a feeler of the depth we teach at GrowthX üí´\\\\nGrowthX is an invite-only club of over 3000 members who are product, marketing, and business leaders, and founders from top internet-first companies like Google, Canva, CRED, Stripe, Netflix, and more üíé\\\\nWe teach our members how to scale revenues via frameworks that can be applied starting next Monday morning. The GrowthX Membership is built on 3 core pillars:\\\\n1. Learning experience: Where you learn the science of revenue-led growth with frameworks actionable the next Monday morning.\\\\n2. Curated community: Where you access a safe space for you to soundboard anything that is stressing you at work.\\\\n3. Career outcomes: Over 35% of members are founders & are able to hire growth teams to scale revenue for their companies while operators are able to get into breakout leadership roles.\\\\nExplore GrowthX Membership üèÜ\\\\nBy Swati‚Äôs calculation with a TAM of 7 Million and an average household grocery spend of 10,000 rupees/ month, the revenue TAM comes down to 704 crores/ month\\\\nWe can say that Swati‚Äôs TAM is way different from Kartik‚Äôs TAM Calculations. But this doesn‚Äôt mean that one of their calculations are wrong.\\\\nTAM calculation is all about making informed assumptions with the data we have in mind\\\\nIn Swati‚Äôs case, she considered the average number of people/ household as 2.5. Hence the major difference in the overall TAM number. In essence, TAM is just to give you an idea about the potential size of the market. It is always changing and is never a number set in stone üöÄ\\\\nHere‚Äôs how the TAM Range will look based on same average household grocery spend of 10,000 rupees/ month ‚è¨\\\\nTAM (In Terms of number of households)\\\\n3 Million\\\\n4 Million\\\\n5 Million\\\\n6 Million\\\\n7 Million\\\\nAvg Household Spend On Groceries\\\\n10,000\\\\n10,000\\\\n10,000\\\\n10,000\\\\n10,000\\\\nTAM (In Terms of Total Achievable Revenue)\\\\n300 Crores/ month\\\\n400 Crores/ month\\\\n500 Crores/ month\\\\n600 Crores/ month\\\\n700 Crores/ month\\\\nWhen you start gathering more data points, you can also do TAM Calculations based on different ICPs and customer segments. This can help you decide everything from Growth strategies to overall product positioning and key business decisions ü§ôüèº\\\\n3. Zepto‚Äôs Growth Strategy\\\\nBased on this market & ICP research, we can create a Growth Strategy for Zepto. The growth strategy contains five main levers which are\\\\nAcquisition\\\\nOnboarding\\\\nEngagement & Retention\\\\nMonetisation\\\\nBuilding a Growth Team\\\\nBut all of these levers don‚Äôt mean anything when you don‚Äôt understand the core goal.\\\\nWe have built this growth strategy using the same foundations we teach our members as part of the GrowthX Learning Experience. If you also want to create structured and outcome driven growth model like this for your startup, check out our experience here üí™üèº\\\\nWhat is Zepto‚Äôs goal for the next 2 - 5 years?\\\\nIf you ask us, we definitely have no clue. So that‚Äôs why we are going to hypothesize their goals based on two things\\\\nTheir current growth numbers\\\\nFounder Interviews on YouTube\\\\nLooking at both, one things becomes very clear. One of their current goals is to grow as quickly as possible. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that they don‚Äôt have profitability in mind. They are looking to grow their revenue numbers with the goal of achieving optimal profitability in the next two to five years.\\\\nThey also understand that anyone can copy their business model and quickly overtake them. So their core goal is to also open new dark stores across various markets, establish their presence, gain users & use that as their MOAT!\\\\nIn simple words, you could hypothesise their goal as\\\\n‚Üí Expand to all Tier 1 cities in India and achieve a revenue of XXXX in YYYY number of years\\\\nSince we don‚Äôt have any insider information about Zepto, we‚Äôre just going to assume the revenue number as $500 Million ARR and year as 3. We assume this because Their CEO mentions in one the interviews that they had easily crossed $100 Million ARR a while back.\\\\nSince acquiring new users is going to play a key role, we are going to prioritise Acquisition as our first lever\\\\nSince retaining these users and getting them back is also key to revenue growth & profitabilty, we‚Äôre going to prioritise Engagement & Retention as our second lever\\\\nSince it‚Äôs a mobile app, we need to make sure any user who‚Äôs downloading it, actually ends up using Zepto. We‚Äôre focusing on our Onboarding lever as the third priority\\\\nFinally, we cannot let profitability be an afterthought. It also needs a bit of focus fro the get go. So we‚Äôre going with our Monetisation lever as the fourth priority\\\\nOnce we break down all these levers, we‚Äôll get a very clear idea on how to build our Growth team. Some common questions like\\\\nWho To Hire?\\\\nWhen To Hire?\\\\nBudgets For Hiring?\\\\nWhich are must have roles and good to have roles?\\\\nNOTE: Your growth strategy is not set in stone. Based on the business goals, the market conditions and tons of other factors, your growth strategy will always be evolving. The best growth minds are always aware of this and are willing to tweak their strategies based on the macro and micro changes üöÄ.\\\\n4. Acquisition\\\\nWe have defined 4 different ICPs in the ideal customer section. Each ICP has a different set of needs and different marketing strategies that work for them.\\\\nA really good growth team understand this and will tweak their marketing strategies based on the ICP they‚Äôre trying to reach.\\\\nFor this case, we‚Äôre just going to look at ICP 1 - The ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô. These are folks in the age range of 20 - 25 and purchase everything from online grocery platforms like Instamart, Zepto & BigBasket.\\\\nWe will only create a Growth Model for this ICP. Since they have a lot of unplanned purchases, their usage frequency is also very high. Also because they are young and have a lot of disposable income, their ability & willingness to spend is also high.\\\\nThe most common acquisition channels to reach our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô are\\\\nYou can use the quick links below to jump to any specific section in our Acquisition Lever\\\\nNow let‚Äôs break down all the acquisition levers for Zepto‚Äôs growth model\\\\nOrganic\\\\nZepto‚Äôs organic strategy for the ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô has three splits. This is based on how they discover new products and where they usually spend their time on.\\\\nSearch Engine Optimisation (SEO):\\\\nSEO is the art of ranking your business when your ideal customer searches for it. Since SEO is a pull channel, you need to identify the different ways in which your customers might search for your product\\\\nHere are some common themes we were able to identify with Search Engine Optimisation.\\\\nHere‚Äôs the breakdown with some common examples\\\\nMost of the keywords here were occupied by market leaders like Amazon & BigBasket. Currently Zepto doesn‚Äôt seem to have an SEO strategy in place. It‚Äôs website is also pretty basic, displaying just information information only about their organisation.\\\\nFor starters, their main competitor BigBasket brings around 6.4 million website visitors from smartphone traffic alone. It‚Äôs the ideal time for Zepto to think about organic SEO strategies if they‚Äôre certain about building this for the long term üöÄ\\\\nTo start with SEO, they need to invest in a website strategy that ties in with their app usage. Most of their users will use Zepto on their app. But the website is primarily to build pages and capture the SEO traffic.\\\\nEventually Zepto will also have to build a full scale website like BigBasket if they want to tap into the fullscale SEO potential.\\\\nApp Store Optimisation(ASO):\\\\nSince Zepto is a mobile app first business, App Store & Play Store discovery is a high priority. App Store Optimisation is the art of ranking your app for relevant searches and in the relevant categories.\\\\nASO can also be broken down into the three types of searches, which we have broken down in the Whimsical below\\\\nApart from search, you also need to ensure your app is free from technical glitches and bugs. Pair this with a healthy number of positive reviews, your app will also be displayed in top positions under\\\\nRelated Applications\\\\nTop Free Apps\\\\nTrending Apps\\\\netc..\\\\nYour best bet is to make sure your app\\\\nIs free from technical glitches\\\\nHas an incredible user experience\\\\nTons of Positive Reviews (Possibly 4+ stars)\\\\nSocial Media:\\\\nSocial Media is yet another untapped opportunity for Zepto. One of the reasons we suggest social media is because\\\\nSwiggy, Zomato and a lot of D2C, FMCg brands have been doubling down on Organic social for the same reasons. While it requires constant effort and a lot of experimentation to stay relevant on social, the efforts gradually pay off.\\\\nSince the ‚ÄòYoung Gun‚Äô ICPs are extremely young and spend a lot of time on social media applications, it makes perfect sense ü§òüèº\\\\nThe Social Media strategy would be a mix of long form content (For YouTube etc) and Short form content (for YouTube Shorts & Reels)\\\\nLong Form Content ‚Üí\\\\nThe general theme of long form content is to provide value first. We can start with things ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô might already be searching for. Since some of them might be living alone, some ideas could be\\\\nCooking Tips\\\\nHome Cleaning Tips\\\\nHealthy Eating Tips\\\\netc‚Ä¶.\\\\nShort Form Content ‚Üí\\\\nShort form content should focus on funny anecdotes and things these folks might find relatable.\\\\nFunny Reels\\\\nRelatable Memes\\\\nQuick Informational Videos\\\\netc‚Ä¶.\\\\nHowever considering the entire macro, social media needs to be inclusive of all ICPs. It should not just be relatable to our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô. The overall brand persona and positioning should also be in mind when creating these strategies.\\\\nZepto has had a very heavy reliance on PAID Ads to grow. It is fair given how their business is location dependant and Paid is the best channel for location based targeting.\\\\nSince PAID Ads can be customised and deployed quite quickly, it‚Äôs Time To Value from them is much quicker. Paid Ads can be divided into three sub categories\\\\nThese are advertisements that will be displayed on search engines like Google, Bing and other platforms. The targeting here is based on individual keywords, rather than just interests or demographic data üöÄ\\\\nProduct Ads:\\\\nProduct based ads which focus on specific products can be extremely useful for Zepto. They have two strategies for product base search ads\\\\nProducts that are low AOV, but high margins (fruits, vegetables etc..)\\\\nProducts that are high AOV, but low margin (Oil, Atta etc..)\\\\nProducts that have a high purchase frequency, but low AOV & ROI (Snacks, Quick Munchies)\\\\nWhich products they want to go after is entirely dependant on a strategy backed by data üíΩ\\\\nBrand Ads:\\\\nBrand Ads can be used for keywords where someone is searching for your product, but you don‚Äôt have the sub pages ready for it.\\\\nOr you can also use it to capitalise on the Inbound search terms until SEO kicks in.\\\\nBrand Ads can also be used to kick out competitors for products which Zepto thinks will give them good retention.\\\\nCompetitor Ads:\\\\nThese ads can be run over competitor pages or also be run over products which Zepto‚Äôs competitor‚Äôs are ranking for. Yet again, this can be used to capture a new market, a new product if you think they might help with your retention rates.\\\\nSocial Ads:\\\\nSocial ads come in really handy when you‚Äôre trying to target based on location, interests or both.\\\\nIf Zepto is trying to scale up each individual dark store chronologically, this is a great way to reach customers. You can target based on age, interests, gender & more based on the data platforms given by advertising platforms ü§òüèº\\\\nWe need to be mindful of two things when running social ads\\\\nWhat‚Äôs the key value proposition for this ICP?\\\\nHow do we convert that into our messaging?\\\\nWhich social platforms are they most active in?\\\\nAs we‚Äôre just focusing on the ‚ÄòYoung Gun‚Äô ICP, we also need to make sure the messaging is on point for them. Their messaging can be derived from their Key Value Propositions such as\\\\n10 Min Delivery\\\\nFresh Groceries At Your Doorstep\\\\nSave Time\\\\nHere‚Äôs how a static ad might look for them on a social media platform\\\\nHere‚Äôs an example of a dynamic ad for Zepto.\\\\nIt‚Äôs both quirky and conveys the Key Value Proposition under 15 seconds. Perfect for social media platforms\\\\nWhile running social ads, we also need to mindful of the platforms each ICP is active on. Our ICP is active on Instagram, Snapchat & Facebook which are all good platforms to start with üé¢\\\\nApp Store Ads:\\\\nSince they‚Äôre an app first platform, it makes a lot of sense to prioritise App Store Ads when you‚Äôre starting with the paid channel. The grocery market is a bit mature thanks to old players like BgBasket, Blinkit and other incumbents\\\\nSo it‚Äôs Zepto‚Äôs best bet to capitalise on the existing search volume on these platforms üöÄ\\\\nApp Store Ads can also be of two types as shown below\\\\nThese ad formats are a different beast in themselves. For the sake of keeping this short we are skipping the technicalities in this section for now.\\\\nThere‚Äôs an universal truth we need to understand before we get into Product Integrations. No app, product or business exists out there in Unison. While your customer is using your product, they are also simultaneously using multiple other products at the same time.\\\\nProduct Integration is the concept of seeking a natural fit with the products used by your users and integrating with them.\\\\nBut some ground rules before we seek Product Integrations\\\\nThe Product should not be a direct competitor to Zepto\\\\nThe Product Integration pitch should feel natural and personalised\\\\nThe product should also have good trust (as trust can be destroyed by partnering with a wrong brand)\\\\nThe product should preferably have the same or higher usage frequency than Zepto\\\\nFrom user interviews conducted by GrowthX members, we have discovered that Zepto users also use some products like UrbanClap, Netflix, Hotstar, EatFit etc‚Ä¶\\\\nHere are some interesting product integrations we can work out with the following products\\\\nUrban Company\\\\nHotstar\\\\nEatFit\\\\nThese are just some examples from the top of our head. Once you do more intense customer research, you will be able to find better products that have a better fit with your offerings.\\\\nPartnerships are lesser known ways to get your brand in front of tons of new customers. Zepto can approach partnerships in two different ways\\\\nInfluencer Partnerships\\\\nProduct Placements\\\\nEach has their merit and difference in their payback periods!\\\\nInfluencer Led Partnerships\\\\nThis essentially focuses on partnering with influencers whom your audience are also hooked into. Most of these partnerships are based on behavioural insights which can be derived from customer calls, surveys etc.\\\\nSince we‚Äôre trying to reach the ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô, we will start with the platforms they‚Äôre most active on - IG & YouTube. Step 2 is understanding the themes or which channels/ pages they follow.\\\\nWe know that this persona is focused on improving their career. So a good place to start is with channels that focus on ‚ÄòCareer specific advice‚Äô. Some of them could also be interested in cooking channels üï∫üèº.\\\\nThe main idea is to identify a theme and then double on those specific channels with a solid pitch.\\\\nProduct Placements\\\\nWeb series & movies are a great way to place your products in a subtle manner. The actor sipping on a cold coffee he ordered from Zepto. Or maybe the family member ordering something on Zepto.\\\\nThese are all subtle pitches to place your products in mainstream movies as well as smaller films & web series.\\\\nUnacademy pulled this off incredibly well with their product placements in tv series like Kota Factory, Operation MBBS etc. Product Placements should feel like natural and in sync with the plot. The core idea is to solidify Zepto as a product everyone uses casually in their life.\\\\nOffline ads probably have one of the best product-channel fits for Zepto because of their hyperlocal nature. When done right, this channel can solve for discovery for a very specific set of ICPs in one location. The best ICP to start with is our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô\\\\nHere are a couple of offline channel ideas to target ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô in their daily life\\\\nThey mostly take an Ola or Uber to reach their workplace\\\\nWe can place ads in autos & cabs behind the driver‚Äôs seat\\\\nThey might take a bus or the use the metro train\\\\nWe can also place banners in specially designated boards at these stops\\\\nThey will use the lift atleast twice a day in their office space\\\\nWe can place an ad inside the lift walls\\\\nThey will walk past the lobby in their office space (preferably an IT park)\\\\nWe can place custom booths that encourage people to download and try Zepto\\\\nOffline channels come in a variety of ways and help us target folks in a very specific locality!\\\\nFor most consumer led applications, referrals can be an incredible acquisition tool. Since our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô are highly social and tech savvy, referral can have a good product market fit for them.\\\\nAll good referral programs will nail 4 things in depth\\\\nThe reward for both the referrer and the referee\\\\nWhy will someone refer?\\\\nWhen will someone refer?\\\\nHow easy it is to refer?\\\\nEach section can use a separate page in reality. But for this guide, we‚Äôre going to focus on Zepto and our target ICP - ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô.\\\\nWhy will someone refer Zepto?\\\\nAt the heart of every successful referral program lies an incredible customer experience. The best reason someone will refer Zepto is when they have a great experience with it. A great experience is delivered when\\\\nThey get their order in under 15 minutes\\\\nThe items are fresh and undamaged\\\\nThe packaging is good\\\\nThey get exactly what they ordered for (not something different - happens frequently in grocery delivery apps)\\\\nTheir AOV of each order is high (Depth)\\\\nThey keep ordering multiple times a week (frequency)\\\\nThe idea here is to identify when someone has a good experience and then take them to the referral loop\\\\nWhen will someone refer Zepto?\\\\nThe discovery of the referral loop should always be placed in the ‚ÄòHappy Flow‚Äô of the customer.\\\\nSome examples of happy flows are\\\\nAfter a customer receives their order in under 15 minutes\\\\nAfter a customer has submitted a review\\\\nThe goal is to identify screens where the user is in a ‚ÄòHappy Flow‚Äô yet it still won‚Äôt hinder the primary goal (complete an order)\\\\nWhat is the reward?\\\\nA good reward does two things\\\\nEnables the customer to keep referring\\\\nEnables the new customers to & old customers to keep using the app\\\\nIn that frame of mind, rewards should be app specific and increase the usage of the app. Monetary rewards are good, but they prevent the users from investing the reward back into the app.\\\\nApp specific coins, coupons and dicsounts are always good currencies for a referral system. One such reward is Zepto‚Äôs ‚ÄòZepto cash‚Äô. It provides both the referrer and the referee with credits they can only use in Zepto.\\\\nHow easy is it to refer?\\\\nEase of a referral system depends on two things\\\\nDiscovery of the referral system\\\\nAbility to Track your referrals\\\\nDiscovery can be solved by showing the referral link in all the ‚ÄòHappy Flows‚Äô and also on the sidebar.\\\\nAbility to track referrals is important because it allows the referrer to understand where his referees are\\\\nHave they clicked on the link\\\\nHave the downloaded the app\\\\nHave they made their first transaction\\\\nBut building a referral program like this is resource intensive and takes up a lot of development effort (even with the use of tools!)\\\\nA good idea is to run a test to a small population before deploying it to tons of users. Some things that can be tested are\\\\nRewards for referee\\\\nRewards for referrer\\\\nPlacement of the referral link\\\\nTracking of the referral link\\\\nDifferent ways to share the referral link\\\\nHere are some metrics Zepto can track to ensure the success of it‚Äôs referral program\\\\nNumber of active users sending invites\\\\nNumber of invites per referrer\\\\nConversion rate to link clicks\\\\nConversion rate to app downloads\\\\nConversion rate to first purchase\\\\nConversion rate to first review\\\\nSo that‚Äôs all about the acquisiton strategies for Zepto ü§òüèº. Now let‚Äôs take a look into the next most important lever for Zepto‚Äôs success - E&R.\\\\nEngagement & Retention are the holy grail of building a successful product in any market. We could even go further and say, Engagement & Retention are the pillars of any successful business.\\\\nGood engagement leads to better retention.\\\\nBetter retention leads to revenue and word of mouth.\\\\nGood revenue means you can invest in the best talent, improve the product even more and rule the market\\\\nWord of mouth means that you can now acquire customers at costs that keep getting lower\\\\nAll these combine into a vicious cycle which make any product/ business successful.\\\\nWhere does retention come here?\\\\nSome of the best product teams think about retention right from the Onboarding. It‚Äôs all about helping the user become powerful with the product. Retention is never an afterthought in any successful product. When done right, retention can drive product & even business decisions.\\\\nHow does Engagement & Retention apply to our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nBefore we even dive into the engagement framework for our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô, we need to understand some basic terms üëáüèº\\\\nFrequency of usage - Number of times someones orders from Zepto\\\\nDepth - No of items ordered in each category (Tomato, Onion, Potato under the vegetables section)\\\\nBreadth - No of categories ordered (1 Vegetable, 2 fruits, 1 Bread, 1 oil etc..)\\\\nThese are the 3 pillars of good engagement.\\\\nBased on these pillars we can define users into 3 buckets üëáüèº\\\\nCasual - People who order from Zepto once a week - once every two weeks\\\\nCore - People who order from Zepto two to three times a week\\\\nPower - People who order from Zepto 4+ times a week\\\\nWe are yet again going to pull excerpts from Aadeesh Deshpande‚Äôs (GX12) assignment on Zepto to deep dive into our framework.\\\\nThere are three types of buying habits for Zepto‚Äôs users üëáüèº\\\\nStock Up - Plan & buy groceries for the entire week\\\\nTop Up - Buying items that generally have a low shelf life (Vegetables, fruits, bread, milk etc.)\\\\nUnplanned Purchases - Items that might have run out without knowledge or items that have a sudden need (Oil, masala powders, Alcohol, Snacks etc..)\\\\nHere are some facts we know about our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô from the table we‚Äôve added above\\\\nCharacteristics\\\\nPotential ICP 1\\\\nName\\\\nYoung Guns\\\\nAge\\\\n21 - 26\\\\nIncome\\\\n8 lakhs/ annum+\\\\nRelationship Status\\\\n‚Üí Unmarried\\\\n‚Üí Sometimes in a relationship\\\\nEmployment Status/ Work Experience\\\\n‚Üí Freshly Employed\\\\nCity\\\\nTier 1\\\\nTech Savvy\\\\nYES\\\\nFrequently Used Social Media Apps\\\\nLinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram\\\\nEntertainment Services Used\\\\nDisney+ Hostar, Zee5, Amazon Prime\\\\nEcommerce services used\\\\nBookMyShow, Amazon, Myntra, Nykaa, Swiggy, Zomato, Zepto, Urban Company\\\\nIncome Spent On\\\\n1.

Late Night\\\\nCustomer AOV\\\\nVery High\\\\nAbility To Spend\\\\nVery High\\\\nShift Needed to Spend on Zepto\\\\nNo Shift Needed\\\\nWe know that they rarely stock up on their daily needs. Most of their purchases are last minute and unplanned. We also know that this segment has a ton of disposable income and has a very low barrier of entry to Zepto.\\\\nWe also know that the majority of this segment live in a Tier 1 city which is where Zepto primarily operates. In his research, Aadeesh has quoted a research paper from Redseer which indicates that 70% of all grocery purchases are a mix of unplanned & top-up puchases.\\\\nSo what‚Äôs the engagement campaign for ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nTitle\\\\nContent\\\\nUnderstanding\\\\nWe know that a ton of Young Guns order from Zepto 2 - 3 times a week.

Desserts (if it‚Äôs dinner)\\\\nWhat does Retention look like for ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nFor Zepto, the best retention happens with both depth (more items in one category) and breadth (ordering from multiple categories). Once they start ordering different items, Zepto becomes the go to place for our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô.\\\\nIncreasing Depth and Breadth makes Zepto their Go-To product which naturally increases their frequency of usage.\\\\nWhich channels drive the best retention for ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nTimely Push Notifications:\\\\nPush Notifications that are backed up data is a great option. Let‚Äôs say one person orders a packet of milk every two days at exactly 9 PM. If they haven‚Äôt ordered milk for the last two days, a push notification asking them to order milk can go out ‚úåüèº\\\\nWhatsApp Notifications:\\\\nWhatsApp notifications can also be triggered as reminders for them.\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume that their favourite milkshake brand was out of stock in their last order. We can run a WhatsApp notification to tell them it‚Äôs back in stock\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume the milk example. We can push a WhatsApp notification to remind them\\\\nSlack or Teams Notifications\\\\nThis is a bit contradictory. But we know that ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô are heavily career focused. So there‚Äôs a very high chance that they may be using an internal communication tool like Slack or Microsoft Teams.\\\\nA quick growth test can be to connect their Slack IDs and send them reminders through them. Although be wary as this is just an hypothesis and hasn‚Äôt been proven by any grocery delivery startup yet!\\\\nWhich Products/ Categories drive the best retention?\\\\nQuick Perishable Items like Milk, Eggs, Bread, Fruits & Vegetables (High freq & high margin)\\\\nFlour, Oil, Rice items\\\\nBathroom & home cleaning equipments\\\\nBath, Body & Hygiene products\\\\nIndulgence items like Biscuits, Chips, Cold drinks, Ice cream etc..\\\\nFinally, why would ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô churn?\\\\nChurn can be divided into two types at the very basic level - Voluntary & Involuntary. Once you understand the reasons someone might churn, your team can work on preventing them. An acute understanding of the reasons can also help you fix issues in your marketing & brand perception\\\\nVoluntary Reasons For Churn\\\\nDelivery Time is too long\\\\nWrong Items were delivered\\\\nItems were delivered to the wrong address\\\\nProducts were damaged during delivery\\\\nExpired products were delivered\\\\nHigh delivery fee\\\\nProducts were out of stock\\\\nInvoluntary Reasons For Churn\\\\nShifted to a new location where Zepto is not available\\\\nOut of town for sometime\\\\nIssue with certain payment portals\\\\nAs you start mapping out all the potential reasons someone might churn, you can trace it back to early signs of churn. For example, if delivery time for a certain user has increased and you see a drop in their frequency, there might be some level of causation at play.\\\\nNegative actions to keep an eye on\\\\nDrop in App Open Rate\\\\nA lot of customer support tickets\\\\nDrop in the frequency of orders\\\\nDrop in basket value\\\\nDrop in weekly/ monthly AOV\\\\nIncrease in Cart Abandonment\\\\nA key concept you should keep in mind. There is a very good difference between causation and correlation.\\\\nIf order frequency is going down while delivery time increases, there is a high chance of relation between the two. But there is also a good chance that there‚Äôs no relation between the two.\\\\nMaybe they had a roommate who just moved out. Hence their order frequency is low\\\\nMaybe they started buying their fruits and vegetables from a street vendor because that was easy\\\\nAs a growth person, before you jump into any conclusions, you need to do the due diligence to understand the reason. You can do this by\\\\nSending a survey,\\\\nLooking at their support tickets\\\\nLooking at the change in items orders before & after change of freq\\\\nScheduling a 1:1 calls with your users\\\\n& more..\\\\nAs a growth person, your goal should be to seek the truth before you confirm your hypotheses.\\\\nWhat are some retention campaigns we can run for our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nThis is an example we‚Äôve pulled out from Aadeesh Deshpande‚Äôs assignment on Zepto. We‚Äôre just tweaking a bunch of the ideas for better presentation.\\\\nConcept\\\\nCampaign Details\\\\nTarget Segment\\\\nCore & Power Users\\\\nTarget ICP\\\\nYoung Guns\\\\nPurchase Behaviour For Core Users\\\\n‚Üí Top Ups and last minute unplanned purchases\\\\n‚Üí Mostly fruits, vegetables, groceries & household items\\\\n‚Üí 5+ products in cart\\\\n‚Üí 3 times a week minimum\\\\nPurchase Behaviour For Power Users\\\\n‚Üí All Categories\\\\n‚Üí 2 to 10 products in cart\\\\n‚Üí 5+ times a week minimum\\\\nGoal\\\\nResurrect Core & Power Users\\\\nCampaign Targeting\\\\nFrequency of orders has reduced.\\\\nReason: Increase in Delivery Time\\\\nProposed Solution\\\\nApologise for the delayed delivery time and compensate with Zepto coins!\\\\nPitch/ Content\\\\nPush Notification on app/ WhatsApp Notification\\\\nWe understand that your time is money.\\\\n3 out of your last 5 deliveries were delayed by more than 15 minutes.

This level of depth will help you prioritise segments in a massive product like Zepto.\\\\nThe same framework can be used for all other voluntary and involuntary churn. As a growth person, your first priority is to understand the reasons and prioritise the solutions on the cohorts which will have the maximum impact.\\\\n6. Onboarding\\\\nSince we‚Äôve prioritised acquisition and engagement & Retention, we‚Äôre not going to focus on the other two levers on this guide. The superpower every growth person must have is the ability to say ‚ÄòNO‚Äô and prioritise with laser focus.\\\\nEven if you have infinite resources to handle, you need to have focus. Focus will help you solve the most important problems effectively. Moreover focus will help you reach your revenue goals effectively!\\\\nBut if you were to work on the Onboarding lever, here are some metrics you could track\\\\nDownload Metrics\\\\nAdd to basket metrics\\\\nCheckout metrics\\\\n‚Üí Channel wise download metrics:\\\\nAds to Downloads\\\\nFacebook ads to app download\\\\nIG Ads to app download\\\\nOrganic to download\\\\nGoogle search to download\\\\nGoogle play store search to download\\\\nApp store search to download\\\\n‚Üí Add to basket metrics:\\\\nNumber of download to registration\\\\nNumber of registrations to ‚ÄòVisited Homepage‚Äô\\\\nNumber of ‚ÄòVisited Homepage‚Äô to ‚ÄòAdd Items to cart‚Äô\\\\nNumber of ‚ÄòAdd Items to cart‚Äô to ‚ÄòVisited Checkout Page‚Äô\\\\n‚Üí Checkout Metrics:\\\\nNumber of items added to cart\\\\nNumber of categories added to cart\\\\nAverage order value\\\\nNumber of users checked out out with COD\\\\nNumber of users checked out with Credit Cards\\\\nNumber of users checked out with UPI\\\\n‚Üí All these metrics can also be further divided into\\\\nDevice\\\\nPlatform\\\\nAcquisition channel\\\\nDark Store\\\\nGeographical Location\\\\nTime\\\\netc‚Ä¶\\\\nThis is a very broad list of metrics you can track to understand your users. As always the metrics you choose will be dependant on your current revenue goals and business priorities.\\\\n7. Monetisation\\\\nFinally, the most important, yet looked upon growth lever is the monetisation lever. Revenue should never be an afterthought for any business. Since this lever is also not a priority at the moment, we are not going to deep dive into it.\\\\nEven before you work on your monetisation lever, you have to run the ‚ÄòLitmus Test‚Äô to understand your retention. Monetisation only works if atleast a certain subset of your users retain after a certain period of time.\\\\nOnce the litmus test is cleared, the monetisation lever has four categories\\\\nWho to charge?\\\\nWhen to charge?\\\\nWhat to charge?\\\\nHow much to charge?\\\\nand that‚Äôs all about the Growth levers for Zepto.\\\\nüí°\\\\nBy the way, the depth you see here is just a feeler of the depth we teach at GrowthX üí´\\\\nGrowthX is an invite-only club of over 3000 members who are product, marketing, and business leaders, and founders from top internet-first companies like Google, Canva, CRED, Stripe, Netflix, and more üíé\\\\nWe teach our members how to scale revenues via frameworks that can be applied starting next Monday morning.

Why is Zepto well positioned to win?\\\\nZepto has grown at breakneck speeds and we truly believe that can win in the long term. Here are some reasons why\\\\n1. Huge market that‚Äôs growing exponentially:\\\\nThe Indian economy is growing at an exponential pace. What happened in the west 20 years back is happening in India currently. As more capital is being poured into the country, new businesses are being formed every day. This leads to a surplus of capital in the economy.\\\\nCapital that can be used to deploy to make you life easier, like buy groceries from Zepto, instead of going to a shop nearby.\\\\nThe picture below shows an estimate of how the Indian economy will grow in the next 25 years.\\\\nThis is the macro shift that BigBasket definitely missed in its formative years.\\\\n2. Customer trust with internet products is growing exponentially:\\\\nThe Indian consumer segment are slowly starting to understand and trust internet products. Before Ola, Flipkart, Myntra and other startups came into play, spending money on the internet was a challenge. And it was not because of the lack of money\\\\nPeople still had disposable income, but the trust levels were quite low. No one were accustomed to spending money on these consumer apps.\\\\nThe advent of internet apps, paired with JIO and UPI changed this game.\\\\nSpending money on the internet became an everyday thing and this naturally improved the trust levels of consumers. Zepto is well positioned at a time where consumer trust on these internet startups is growing exponentially.\\\\n3. Backed by an experienced leadership team:\\\\nThere‚Äôs a reason why Zepto went from zero to 2000+ employees in a matter of two years. Right from the get go, the founders were keen on hiring experienced leader for their management team.\\\\nThey hired folks who had already done that startup journey in the same or a related field. Some of their most senior hires were\\\\nTheir CFO, Jitendra N was already a VP of Finance at Pharmeasy\\\\nTheir CBO, Viral Jhaveri had worked leadership roles in Uber Eats and FreighTigers\\\\nTheir People function is headed by Roma Bindroo handled the people function at Johnson & Johnson for multiple years\\\\nThe founders understood that Zepto is still an operations heavy business with some software at the front. Even if they make the software 100x better, the operations cannot be avoided.\\\\nThey understood the game and started hiring folks who understood operations heavy businesses in the first place. This allowed them to reduce mistakes and scale faster than ever!\\\\nüöÄ\\\\nIf you‚Äôre a leader or a founder, keen to hire the Top 1% Growth Talent in India, do register to our waiting list here. We have helped 100+ top startups like CRED, PayTm, Swiggy & Dunzo hire their Growth talent.\\\\nPlease do fill out the form and one of our Talent Team superstars will reach back to you üí™üèº\\\\n4. Changing customer behaviour:\\\\nWith the boom of the economy, customer behaviour is also changing constantly. More customers are now starting to value Convenience >> Money.\\\\nStartups like Swiggy, Uber, Urban Company are a true testament to this!\\\\n5. High driver retention rate:\\\\nZepto has a 7% higher delivery driver retention rate than all hyperlocal delivery startups in India. This is because of a couple of reasons\\\\nZero long distance deliveries - Drivers hate nothing more than long distance deliveries\\\\nA centralised hub for all drivers - Since Zepto operates only out of dark stores, this gives them a chance to provide a designated waiting area for delivery partners. The founder mentioned that they also provide their partners with water, snacks & otehr condiments to make their life easier.\\\\nWhile 7% maybe a marginal amount, it can eventually add up. Driver experience is a key piece in winning this hyperlocal war. Since there is no penalty or drivers when they jump ships, the player who retains the most, eventually wins in the long term.\\\\n6. High NPS:\\\\nZepto was founded on the core insight of high NPS from the days of Kiranakart (their old startup). Basically customers who received their orders in less than 15 minutes had a higher NPS compared to customers who got it later.\\\\nSince Zepto is built on this core insight, their NPS is close to 80% (which is spectacular)\\\\n7. High Customer Retention rate:\\\\nYet again, during the days of Kiranakart, the founders realised that customers who recieved orders in less than 15 minutes retained better. The 15 min delivery is a WOW factor, around which Zepto is entirely built out of.\\\\nThis helps them own a retention rate of 60% even with 2 million+ customers & growing!\\\\n8. Wave 2 startups FTW:\\\\nWave 1 startups are the BigBaskets and Flipkarts of India. They faced a lot of challenges in terms of the MACRO\\\\nTalent\\\\nEconomical Growth\\\\nConsumer Trust\\\\nPayments\\\\nConsumer Sentiment etc\\\\nIn the last 10 years however, the entire Macro of India has shifted in favour of startups üëáüèº\\\\nThe talent pool has become denser (lots of people who have been there and done that)\\\\nThe economy has grown and is growing by leaps and bounds\\\\nThe people have more trust on Internet startups\\\\nPaying for something has become incredibly easier (thanks to UPI and all the Fintech startups)\\\\nConsumer have started spending more money rather than just saving it\\\\n9. They have solved for delivery accuracy:\\\\nA big challenge with old age grocery delivery startups is order accuracy. Issues like missing some items or even delivering the wrong items is terrible customer experience. The customer on the other end orders grocieries for convenience. Missed or wrong deliveries is probably the most inconvenient thing for them.\\\\nThe founding team developed Zepto with a razer focus of delivering the right order on time. The pay close attention to the dispatch process and fill any leaks to prevent wrong deliveries.\\\\nOther incumbents like Swiggy Instamart, BigBasket have also fixed this in the recent days. Should be interesting to see how they fare against Zepto in the future.\\\\n10. Expanding to new locations:\\\\nZepto‚Äôs founder mentioned in an interview is doubling in business every three months. This is possible because of their rapid expansion to new locations with a ton of darkstores. Since their inception, Zepto has grown from one store in Mumbai to 75+ locations across Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata and other tier 1 metro cities.\\\\nThis has been possible because of an experienced management team and high focus on creating formalised processes for everything!\\\\n11. Expanding to different categories:\\\\nZepto started with just groceries, but now they‚Äôve expanded to beauty accessories, baby products and even electronics. As they slowly figure out the supply chain and formulate the entire process, they can add more categories to this. An example could be umbrellas & raincoats during monsoon.\\\\nThe sky is the limit when they have the supply chain figured out for everything.\\\\n12. Execution On Point:\\\\nGrocery delivery is not a huge innovation. BigBasket and many other incumbents have already done it and grown massively. Even the 15 min delivery can be figured out by other players in a matter of time.\\\\nThe biggest strength of team Zepto is their ability to execute. Momentum is a very sneaky element that exponentially increases your success.\\\\nWhile other players are changing their business model to fit the 10 min delivery, Zepto is already acing it. The first mover advantage alone will carry them far above the finish line. By providing an incredible service, they can retain to all their customers while other incumbents are still building for the market.\\\\n5. What are the reasons Zepto might also lose in the hyper competitive grocery space?\\\\nThere are always two sides to any coin. If there are a couple of reasons why Zepto will win, there are even more reasons as to why it might lose. We wouldn‚Äôt do justice to this guide without looking at those points too!\\\\n1. Expanding to Tier 2 cities will be a challenge:\\\\nTier 1 cities currently contribute to almost the entire revenue of Zepto. Last time we checked, there were no Zepto owned darkstores in tier 2+ cities. Zepto will reach a plateau as they expand across all tier 1 cities.\\\\nThey can only unlock even more growth when they reach tier 2 cities. However tier 2+ cities are built different in terms of\\\\nPopulation distribution\\\\nMindset\\\\nCustomer sentiment\\\\nBuilding Zepto for tier 2+ cities will require a whole different mindset that the current model. They will have to rethink everything which will require time & a lot of money.\\\\n2. Not all dark stores will be profitable:\\\\nThe cold truth is that not all darkstores will be profitable. Power laws can be crazy in business and a small percentage of the dark stores may end up generating the most amount of revenue.\\\\nThe hard part about this is each darkstore, irrespective of revenue will have a fixed operating cost. This will be split between\\\\nSalaries\\\\nRent\\\\nOther bills\\\\nSo at some point Zepto will have to decide between closing low revenue locations or keeping them alive for just overall brand visibility.\\\\n3. White-labelling products is an operational challenge:\\\\nThere is only so much you can earn from selling other brands. That‚Äôs exactly why so many supermarkets end up creating their own products like rice, oil, bread etc..\\\\nIt allows them to control the supply chain and take a bigger share of the revenue pie.\\\\nHowever producing your own products is also investment heavy. While production is the first challenge, Quality Control & Branding is an even bigger challenge. Acquisitions can come in handy for this play.\\\\nWe‚Äôll just have to wait and see how Zepto play this card out!\\\\n4. Free Delivery might hit on the margins:\\\\nWhile ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô is great for the growth stage, it is not sustainable for overall sustenance. At some point, Zepto will have to cut down on ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô. Or they might also need to increase the minimum threshold for ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô.\\\\nThis might lead to a drop in order frequency and users jumping to competitor products who do offer ‚Äò Free Delivery‚Äô.\\\\n5. Zero Cost Of Switching:\\\\nThe biggest problem with hyperlocal startups like this is the switching cost. Or should we say that there isn‚Äôt say.\\\\nWhat is a switching cost?\\\\nIt is the cost a customer has to pay when they decide to use another application. For example, when someone decided to use another SaaS app, the switching cost is loss of data. If they decide to play another game, they will end up losing all their progress and having to start from scratch.\\\\nEssentially, switching cost is a hidden cost that prevents a customer from using another app.\\\\nSince there is ‚ÄòZero Switching Costs‚Äô customer can have all of their competeitors on the phone and order from anyone of required. If they get one or two bad experiences, they might immediately jump to a competeitor.\\\\nIf BigBasket can also consistently deliver in under 15 minutes, Zepto is no longer a ‚Äòmust-have‚Äô but a ‚ÄòGood to have‚Äô.\\\\n6. 10 min model is replicable:\\\\nOne big IP risk is that their min model is incredible 10 in delivery can be implemented by anyone. All they need is some capital to frontload their darkstore and they‚Äôre good to go. To Retain customers in the long run, Zepto will have to keep providing on their promise of quick delivery.\\\\n7. Change in government regulations:\\\\nA lot of things need to go right for internet startups to succeed in India. Once such thing are the government regulations. As of now, Zepto can classify their drivers as partners and not employees. This allows them to pay their drivers like a consultant rather than an employee.\\\\nThis also includes all drivers who operate with Swiggy, Zomato and other delivery partners.\\\\nIf one day, the government mandates that they should also be treated as employees, it will mess with their entire P&L and might even sink the business.\\\\n8. Lose out on the waiting game\\\\nThe team behind is executing well, but can they maintain it for the long term. Old players like BigBasket are flush with an instream of capital from the TATA group. While Zepto is dependant on investor money to stay afloat. Sure, most of their darkstores eventually ramp up and start earning revenue.\\\\nBut what if players like BigBasket decide to cut Zepto on delivery costs & margins?\\\\nThis will be a long game where Zepto can only win if they are fiscally discipline and provide a stellar experience.\\\\nThese are some of the reasons we think Zepto might fail in the next 2 - 5 years.\\\\nHowever no one can predict the future and these are all just speculations up to this point. But as a growth and business person, it is your job to constantly speculate, hypothesise and play the devil‚Äôs advocate to future proof your business.\\\\nWe hope you enjoyed reading this blog.\\\\nüöÄ\\\\nIf you have any feedback, please do leave them in the TypeForm here. We want to make this blog 100X better for you, so we take all your feedback seriously!\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto‚Äôs Amritansu Nanda speaks to Social Samosa about creating a viral character on the internet, their competitive marketing strategy and plans ahead.\\\\nThe Quick Commerce segment is a rapidly growing industry. Zepto, a quick commerce app launched in 2021 by Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, entered the Q-commerce segment by offering 10-minute delivery and a convenient shopping experience.\\\\nThe brand has grown at a rapid rate in a short span of time by adopting the dark store method and expanding their footprint in cities across the nation, including Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Ghaziabad, Noida, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Pune, and Mumbai.\\\\nThis space is projected to reach US$1,408.00 million in 2023 and is largely divided between Zepto, Zomato‚Äôs Blinkit, Swiggy‚Äôs Instamart, Dunzo, BB Now, and more.\\\\nZepto has 259k followers on Instagram, 60.6k subscribers on YouTube, and 26.8k followers on Twitter.\\\\nTo understand what helped the brand take a leap in marketing in a short span of time, we spoke to Amritansu Nanda, CMO - Zepto.\\\\nThe Humour Route\\\\nSince its inception, Zepto‚Äôs campaigns have taken a humorous route. The brand‚Äôs campaigns, which are mostly 30 seconds long, emphasise its quick delivery promise.\\\\nThe campaigns also showcase everyday struggles, trying to relate with consumers on a personal level and providing a solution to their everyday problems. For example, in one of its early campaigns, Zepto showed a young guy going to work, getting ready for his busy day ahead and his morning routine interrupted by his furry friend as he chews off his toothbrush. This is where Zepto comes to his rescue.\\\\nSharing what led to these campaigns and the overall idea behind Zepto‚Äôs marketing strategy, Amritansu Nanda told Social Samosa, ‚ÄúOur focus remains on differentiating the brand from not only competitors but preferably from everything else that\\\\\\'s there on the user\\\\\\'s mobile phone.‚Äù\\\\nThe brand used, the ‚ÄúNeed it quick‚Äù tagline in these early days, clearly stating the problem they were trying to solve. While Swiggy Instamart had the early mover advantage they also had the onus of explaining what Quick Commerce is why the consumers need it, Zepto on the other hand had the benefit of the QSR industry already being introduced.\\\\nFurther amping up its marketing presence, Zepto collaborated with celebrities such as Shankar Mahadevan, Usha Uthup, and Kailash Kher.\\\\nAlso Read: Expert speak: How AI in advertising is an enabler rather than a threat\\\\nJust like their other campaigns, these films focused on consumer struggles. This time, it highlighted the pain point of ‚Äòwaiting‚Äô for deliveries. Through this, the brand tried to establish their punctuality quotient through the ‚ÄòGroceries Delivered On Time, Always!‚Äô tagline.\\\\nThe Making Of Sharma Ji\\\\nIn its recent marketing efforts, Zepto has tried to further shape up its brand identity by making ‚ÄòSharma Ji‚Äô the face of its brand. Realising the internet love for quirky characters, Zepto created ‚ÄòUncle Ji‚Äô before its new campaign launch.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs Sharma Ji kept showing up across our social media feeds and pretty much all over our everyday digital existence, mirroring our concerns. The brand created a separate Instagram channel, featuring memes, Reels, GIFs, and stickers ft Uncle Ji to be a part of everyday conversations. Uncle‚Äôs sassy personality, blatant realities, and the catchphrase ‚ÄòNahi milega‚Äô were at the core of all communication.\\\\nAccording to the brand, the character garnered organic traction with 10 Million impressions with 10% engagement across all social media platforms; trending at #6 on Twitter, and shared by popular Twitter celebs (CricCrazyJohns, dudeitsokay, shreemiverma) and Instagram Meme pages (Trolls Official, Emo Bois of India, and more). Sharmaji gained 30K+ followers in a very short span of time.\\\\nAfter building Sharmaji‚Äôs character and leveraging its virality, Zepto later announced its campaign ‚ÄòNahi Milega.‚Äô The brand unveiled three short films featuring the online sensation and the face of the brand‚Äôs new campaign. This campaign was executed by EarlyMan Film.\\\\nNanda mentioned that with the new campaign, the brand intended to break the clutter and rather than directly conveying their point ‚Äì Quick Delivery, they took the ‚Äòsetting the context approach‚Äô and hoped to land on the correct audiences page.\\\\nQuick Memes to Connect\\\\nZepto‚Äôs core TG are the urban dwellers who live a fast-paced lifestyle and these consumers spend a great amount of time on social media channels on a daily basis.\\\\nOn connecting with this audience base, Nanda said, ‚ÄúWhen it comes to campaigns like the one featuring Uncle Ji, Zepto‚Äôs media mix is a 50-50 between digital penetration and other offline mediums like OOH and other traditional media.‚Äù\\\\nThe brand‚Äôs social media handle engages with the audience with a healthy amount of memes and relatable everyday issues. The brand‚Äôs social media posts are a guide to all the things the quick commerce platform has to offer. With topical posts, memes, and jumping-on-moment marketing, the brand tries to connect with the TG.\\\\nThe Future of Zepto\\\\nEarlier this year, Zepto launched a new program for farmers called ‚ÄòZepto Bloom,‚Äô thereby increasing their penetration deeper into the country.\\\\nWith the penetration of Q-commerce slowly inching towards Tier II and tier III markets, Nanda mentioned that although it\\\\\\'s an interesting market to cover, Zepto‚Äôs marketing plan doesn‚Äôt have a concrete plan for the said market. He also mentioned that in the future, with Zepto being a hyperlocal platform, no market is going to be ignored at large.\\\\nIn the coming years, Zepto is planning to push heavily towards MarTech and not just focus on its digital penetration. Nanda also mentioned that the brand is going to explore other tech areas like AI that might help in the brand‚Äôs communication.\\\\n                \\\\n                Introduction\\\\nLaunched in April 2021, Zepto has rapidly transformed the landscape of e-commerce in India with its ambitious promise of delivering groceries in just 10 minutes. Founded by Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, both 19-year-old Stanford dropouts, Zepto emerged from the need for faster grocery delivery, a demand that surged post-COVID. Based in Mumbai, the company has quickly expanded its operations across major Indian cities and attracted significant investor interest. This case study delves into Zepto‚Äôs journey, its innovative business model, and the challenges it faces in a competitive market.\\\\nCompany Overview\\\\nZepto began its journey in Bandra, Mumbai, and has since grown its presence to cities such as Pune, Delhi, Bangalore, and Kolkata. With impressive funding of $360 million from investors like Y Combinator and Glade Brook Capital Partners, Zepto‚Äôs valuation has reached $900 million. Despite this rapid growth and substantial financial backing, the company is still grappling with profitability challenges.\\\\nCore Strategy: Dark Stores and Technology\\\\nZepto‚Äôs operational model centers around ‚Äúdark stores‚Äù ‚Äì strategically located warehouses stocked with high-demand items to ensure rapid delivery. These dark stores are not open to the public, minimizing unsold stock and optimizing fulfillment efficiency. Leveraging AI and advanced analytics, Zepto manages its inventory and delivery routes to achieve its promise of delivering goods within 10 minutes. The average delivery time reported by CEO Aadit Palicha is 8 minutes and 47 seconds.\\\\nRevenue Model and Financial Performance\\\\nZepto‚Äôs revenue generation strategy involves:\\\\n- Profit Margins from Inventory: Zepto negotiates margins with brands based on the products stored in its dark stores.\\\\n- Advertising and Premium Listings: Brands pay for visibility through ads and top search results on the Zepto platform.\\\\nIn FY22, Zepto reported revenues of INR 142.3 Crores but incurred a significant loss of INR 390.3 Crores. The major expenses included:\\\\n- Marketing: INR 175.5 Crores\\\\n- Stock Purchases: INR 213.2 Crores\\\\n- Employee Benefits: INR 50.3 Crores\\\\n- Supply Chain Costs: INR 74 Crores\\\\nZepto‚Äôs EBITDA margin in FY22 was notably negative at -259.39%, reflecting the company‚Äôs struggle with high operational costs and low profitability.\\\\nCompetitive Landscape\\\\nZepto operates in a highly competitive environment with rivals such as Blinkit and Dunzo. Blinkit, valued at $1 billion and supported by numerous investors, and Dunzo, backed by Google, present significant competition.

Just like window shopping, you can select and buy groceries that will be delivered to you. However, most of the delivery services take almost thirty minutes to deliver the product but there is a company that delivers the groceries within 10 minutes after placing the order. That company is none other than ‚ÄúZepto.‚Äù\\\\nHave you ever wondered how Zepto delivers the order so quickly and how it gained its reputation within three years of establishment? The reason behind this success is their impactful and smart business technique. This article provides an explanation of the ‚ÄúZepto Business Model.‚Äù\\\\nThe business model of Zepto consists of three essential components-\\\\n- Working Strategy\\\\n- Marketing Strategy\\\\n- Revenue Sources\\\\nWorking Strategy\\\\nThe main objective of Zepto is to provide the best and quickest service to its customers. The efficient working strategy of Zepto is based on four pillars, namely-\\\\n1: Q- Commerce\\\\nIt stands for quick commerce. It is an instant service model of e-commerce where the marketing and dealings (buying & selling) of products & services occur on the internet. Zepto efficiently utilizes the internet to execute its business. The customers place their orders on the Zepto app and their products are delivered quickly with the help of dark store models or micro markets. It delivers various types of items like fresh produce, snacks, beverages, dry rations, cleaning items, personal care items, etc.\\\\n2: Dark Store Model\\\\nThis is the core working strategy of Zepto. The dark stores are Micro Warehouses (the physical outlets) specially installed for the distribution of the products. These are not open to visitors i.e., you cannot buy the products directly (offline) from the distribution outlets of Zepto. The dark store uses advanced AI-powered technology to perform various tasks ranging from placement of orders, packaging the products, mapping the traffic-free routes for quick delivery routes, and buying fresh grocery items from the bulk distributors. You need to place the order on the Zepto app. Thereafter, their team fulfills the orders and delivers the product to your doorstep.\\\\n3: Key Partners\\\\nThere are three key partners of Zepto- Local Stores, Financial Partners, and Delivery Partners. Zepto buys the groceries in bulk from the local stores and transfers them into the dark stores (micro warehouses). The financial partners aid in the digital payment systems for Zepto. The delivery partners help in the delivery of products from dark stores to customers.\\\\n4: Usage of AI‚ÄìPowered Technology\\\\nAI-powered technology is the key reason for the smooth working of Zepto. It utilizes location intelligence and geospatial data to determine the target population/audience, geographical location of the customers, patterns of roads, traffic dynamics (to select the roads having less traffic/crowd), supply availability (availability of the products that the customer ordered), weather conditions (for instance, heavy rainfall may disrupt the product delivery), values of the real estate (for establishing a dark store), etc.\\\\nIn short, the customers register and log in to the Zepto app and place an order. The dark store present in the nearest location of the customer receives the notification about the order of the customer. The team present in the dark store packs the item and hands it over to the delivery partner. The delivery man delivers the order to the location of the customer by using the quickest possible route. Finally, the customer receives the product and makes the payments.\\\\nMarketing Strategy\\\\nThe marketing strategy of Zepto mainly involves online Ad campaigns. The ad campaigns of Zepto are one of the best among its competitors. Their advertisements are quirky enough with the tagline of ‚Äú10-minute delivery‚Äù and ‚Äúzero delivery charges‚Äù to hit the target audience and encourage them to use Zepto app. The quick delivery of products within 10 minutes is the USP (Unique Selling Proposition) that helps it stand out among its competitors. Other than ad campaigns, Zepto uses the following marketing strategies-\\\\n- Social Media Marketing\\\\n- Influencer Marketing\\\\n- Television commercials\\\\nRevenue Sources\\\\nThe major revenue of Zepto lies in its ‚ÄúCommission Based Model‚Äù and funding rounds.\\\\n- Commissions‚Äì It receives a commission of 2-4% on each order placed through its app. These commissions help to cover the costs of the expenditures.\\\\n- Funding Rounds- It raised a significant amount of money through multiple funding rounds. As of today, the value of Zepto is around USD 900 million.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nThe impactful working and marketing strategy of Zepto has played a key role in the success of this quickest-growing startup. It works on a brilliant business model that contributes to the accomplishment of the tasks within the stipulated time. As a result, it gained broader customer reach and effectively boosts contactless shopping for customers.\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto\\\\\\'s 10-Minute Grocery Delivery and Customer Acquisition Strategies - Case Study\\\\nExploring Zepto\\\\\\'s Revolution: Redefining Grocery Delivery\\\\nIntroduction:\\\\nIn an era defined by instant gratification, Zepto emerged as a disruptor in the grocery delivery landscape, promising to deliver essentials to your doorstep within a jaw-dropping 10 minutes.

Here you can find the document attached.\\\\nWith 10 ‚Äî Min grocery delivery becoming new normal, Dark stores are defined as Lifeblood of this startup. Let‚Äôs deep dive into this interesting business model, strategy, Key elements that drives this business, their own challenges, my own personal experience with Zepto services and finally a conclusion.\\\\nWhat does ‚ÄúZepto‚Äù denotes ?\\\\nZepto (unit symbol z) is a unit prefix in the metric system denoting a factor of 10‚àí21, i.e. 0.000000000000000000001 Zeptosecond.\\\\nFounders and their Business Model\\\\nZepto business model was developed by Aadit Palicha (Founder-CEO) and Kaivalya Vohra (Founder & CTO) who were both 19 at the time when they were university drop out. Zepto unique business model promises to deliver the grocery in 10 minutes and this may go upto 20 but the time is being informed to customer as soon as they do add to cart and even before making the order Zepto usually does not put a limit on the number of products a user can order. But the delivery time increases depending on order size and the distance between the delivery location and their dark stores also based on the traffic, rain and other climatic conditions.\\\\nThe company began its operations in Mumbai in 2021 and extended its operations to Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore, Gurgaon, Hyderabad, Pune, Noida, Kolkata, Ghaziabad. They are operating the Delivery from 7 AM ‚Äî 1 AM. The business of online grocery delivery is already taking off in India with a $1 trillion retail market perceived and expected to grow at very fast rate.\\\\nMy Personal Review\\\\nBefore we deep dive into their Business model, strategy, challenges etc., Let me share my personal experience of ordering groceries in Zepto app from Chennai. Just to share my own experience in terms of Quality of products, Delivery speed, customer support etc. I ordered items for total Rs.520 to get additional discount.\\\\nHere I noticed some of key aspects that makes Zepto a true differentiator from its competitors in the segment.\\\\n¬∑ Timer clock starts immediately after placing the order in the app and order gets delivered within the committed time with proper packaging. This excites the customer which is completely a new experience for us in India.\\\\n¬∑ Mobile App UI/UX was so user friendly and appealing to use and play around. There are few micro level enhancements is needed but it‚Äôs no more a showstopper for a normal user.\\\\n¬∑ In order to make this delivery within very short time, entire Supply chain process is optimized, well planned in such a way all Groceries were packed in different weights according to the listing of product in app even before getting the orders and placed in the well designated bins in dark stores.\\\\nSo, it‚Äôs very easy for person to go to these bins as per the received order -> Handed over to Billing section ‚Äî Billed -> Handed over to the Last mile Delivery person.\\\\n¬∑ Prices of almost all the listed items were reasonable, in fact price was less than the brick-and-mortar shops without any additional delivery charges if minimum total value is above 100 INR and special discounts applicable if total value 500 INR. This subsequently results in increase of total sales and profits end of day.\\\\n¬∑ Interesting to notice, Fruits that are costly in general were listed in Pieces instead of 500 gms / 1 Kg. Customers has no clue to think and compare this price by converting price per Kg, it‚Äôs very hard to do it while ordering. Pricing team did a smart job here. At same time, customers wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to buy one piece of Dragon fruit for Rs.99 instead of getting surprised to see Rs.300 /500 grams and there is higher possibility that they may not add to cart and move forward leaving this item.\\\\nExample: Apple, Pomegranate, Dragon fruits were listed in pieces. Dragon fruit ‚Äî Rs.99/Piece etc. When we see price per piece looks cheap or reasonable over seeing per kg which would normally be Rs.400-Rs.600 above. It‚Äôs human nature.\\\\n¬∑ I want to mention the amazing experience from customer support team of Zepto. I tried reaching them via Online chat & On call support on 28th March 2022. I was able to reach the team within less than a minute. Later I came to know the team operates from 7 am ‚Äî 2 am IST and they were able to help us with the query with great sense of patience and customer friendly nature. Kudos to the entire team.\\\\nScope for Improvement:\\\\n¬∑ As of now Zepto doesn‚Äôt have option to pay via Sodexo vouchers which is a highly needed as most of millennials do have this vouchers to save tax. This is not a big deal for Zepto to incorporate. Hope they will add it very soon.\\\\n¬∑ Can give option to customers to choose their comfortable time slots for Delivery. This will let the customers who want to place orders in advance and want to make the delivery time of their choice. As of now users are forced to get the delivery immediately in 10‚Äì20 minutes irrespective of their own choice of time.\\\\nWhat are the possible levers that drives the business growth of Zepto further?\\\\n¬∑ Huge young population in India with deep penetration of smart phones with Internet access.\\\\n¬∑ Rise in the earning population\\\\n¬∑ Millennials no more want to prefer brick and mortar shops for buying Groceries, Veg, fruits to save their time, money, fuel etc.\\\\nScalability\\\\nHere I have added my personal view where I see there is huge scope for scaling the business in India.\\\\n¬∑ Expanding to Tier 2, Tier 3 cities in India.\\\\n¬∑ Expanding to other geographies ‚Äî fast growing economies and under penetrated countries.\\\\n¬∑ Expanding product portfolio not limited to only Groceries. There is ample scope to add new segments like Medicines, 100% organic Vegetables/Fruits/Provisions etc to pull more crowd.\\\\n¬∑ More scope to add few more thousands of product catalogs in the app which will happen gradually.\\\\nChallenges\\\\nStrong competitors for Zepto are Flipkart (Backed by Walmart), Amazon, Blinkit-formerly Grofers (Backed by softbank group), Dunzo (Backed by Google), Swiggy (Backed by Naspers Limited) etc. These competitors will definitely try to copy this 10 minute delivery model across their grocery segments. We need to wait and watch the next move of these large corporates where their warehouse and entire supply chain process already got established in the market.\\\\nConclusion:\\\\nIt‚Äôs undoubtedly, Zepto is a providing ‚ÄúWOW‚Äù services to the end customers, growing faster than anyone else in this niche model at the moment with proven 10 minutes delivery model with a well-established, advanced Supply chain process leveraging A.I and various algorithms in place.\\\\nThey were able to afford, attract great leadership team from their competitors like Amazon, Flipkart, Walmart etc which laid amazing foundation for a startup like Zepto.\\\\nMany players in the market are pushed to try this 10 min delivery but it‚Äôs not so easy to consistently honor this promise every time. Where Dunzo normally takes 20- 30 minutes for the same delivery but even though they don‚Äôt claim to be time bound. It needs lot of high level ground work, Advanced Planning and Supply chain process, Micro level dark stores established every 3‚Äì4 km.\\\\nIt‚Äôs needless to say, if it‚Äôs possible for Zepto it‚Äôs also possible for other large giants to implement if they have concrete clear vision, strategy, time and investment. Zepto is a detail-oriented and intense business with strong technical and operating discipline that allows them to successfully establish the model of 10-minute delivery.\\\\nFinally, I‚Äôm ending with this statement, ‚ÄúZepto ‚Äî A Unicorn in the making!!‚Äù Way to go ‚Ä¶\\\\nThanks for taking your valuable time to go through my Case study on this product ‚Äî ‚ÄúZEPTO‚Äù.

Before you get blinded by the success and commotion that your app can create, ask yourself if you have what it takes to dethrone the present best grocery delivery service in India, Zepto.\\\\nZepto is a grocery delivery service that delivers customers\\\\\\' orders in under ten minutes and heavily depends on dark stores to function quickly and efficiently. And to your amazement, Zepto saw a vast and impressive 946% growth in users between December 2021 and March 2022 (according to data that an artificial intelligence startup Bobble AI released).\\\\nEven though this grocery delivery service is new, it has jolted its contemporaries. It can even defeat your Startup if you remain careless. Hence to avoid such a mishap, read the blog to learn eight fascinating things from Zepto and its business model.\\\\nWhat is Zepto?\\\\nIt is a Mumbai-based Startup delivering happiness in the guise of groceries to people in under 10 minutes. This excellent service is the brainchild of Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, who saw the light of day in April 2021.\\\\nThis delivery service heavily depends on dark stores and, so far, has worked with 86 dark store owners in approximately 13 different areas. Some of its rivals are Blinkit, Dunzo and BigBasket.\\\\nToday, this Startup is worth $900 million and has given tough competition to those already in the market before its arrival. Indeed, there is much to learn for an entrepreneur from Zepto and its business model. And without further adieu, let us begin the journey of learning a thing or two from Zepto!\\\\n8 Fascinating Things You Can Learn From Zepto And Its Business Model\\\\nThis service came into existence during the pandemic when people could not get necessities such as groceries quickly. And at that time, it gave them the convenience of receiving groceries within 10 minutes.\\\\nLooking at how fast it made a lasting impression on people‚Äôs minds, people eager to launch a similar product can learn a lot from Zepto and its business model. We have tried to list the things that helped the company become what it is today! These things are:\\\\n1. Striking Brand Name\\\\nBefore you launch your venture, keeping a name for your company that attracts people\\\\\\'s attention is advisable. Besides being catchy, your brand name should tell people in a few words what your brand does.\\\\nFor instance, Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra named their company Zepto, which denotes a factor of 10-21. They have kept such a name for their services that indicates little time and manages to tell people in one word what Zepto does; delivering groceries in under 10 minutes.\\\\n2. Usage of the right colors\\\\nThe color combination you select for your brand\\\\\\'s logo also plays a pivotal role in attracting attention. Thus, it will be better to take some time to consider which colors to use in your logo for your grocery delivery service.\\\\nFor instance, Zepto\\\\\\'s logo is in striking reddish-pink color. Red is a warm color and invokes feelings of happiness, optimism, and energy. Besides these feelings, other emotions that warm colors evoke are urgency and grabbing effects, as in taking quick action in response to something. Talking about the other color they used, that is Pink, it is one of the happy colors.\\\\nTherefore, you must spend time selecting colors for your brand and its logo.\\\\n3. Tagline\\\\nSometimes people might not know the meaning of the word you have used in your brand\\\\\\'s name. Therefore, a tagline explaining what you do is a must.\\\\nFor instance, Zepto\\\\\\'s tagline is \"Groceries delivered in 10 minutes\", which clearly shows people what they will get if they use Zepto\\\\\\'s service.\\\\nThus, you should try to create attractive taglines that clearly state what benefits people will get if they use your delivery service.\\\\n4. Involve Technology\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s business model also includes an app called Locus, an artificial intelligence application employing Google API (Application Programming Interface). This app shows all relevant information on Zepto\\\\\\'s dashboard.\\\\nThus, incorporating technology in your business model will let you get all the necessary data on your devices as soon as possible and help you make deliveries quickly.\\\\n5. Dark Stores\\\\nDark stores are distribution centers that are unavailable to everyone except retail enterprises. Adding dark stores to your business model is advisable if you want to deliver groceries quickly.\\\\nThese warehouses quickly handle orders and provide customers with tools and alternatives such as online buying, in-store pickup, and same-day delivery.\\\\n6. Solve a pressing problem\\\\nThis part is a bit tricky. When you launch a grocery delivery service, you need to understand that many such services are already available today. And in such a situation, you need to stand out from the crowd to gain attention.\\\\nIn Zepto delivery\\\\\\'s case, the pressing problem was the inability of people to get groceries quickly during the pandemic. Zepto App solved this problem, and as a result, more and more people started using and trusting this service.\\\\nThus, when you launch your grocery delivery service, ensure that you explain to people what you will provide to them that solves their problems.\\\\n7. Enticements\\\\nZepto entices new customers by offering a bunch of things to new users. Suppose you are using Zepto delivery for the first time. In this case, it promises a delivery period of 7 to 10 minutes based on your location.\\\\nThey also offer their new users a discount of around 25 to 30% or up to 50% besides free delivery.\\\\nUnlike its rivals, it does cash burn only once or twice.\\\\nIt shows that you must develop new ideas and programs to attain and retain customers.\\\\n8. Advertisement/ Marketing\\\\nAdvertising your brand is necessary as it helps you make more people know about your organization. You can have advertisements run on TV, erect hoardings, make catchy jingles, or engage in online marketing to generate your brand awareness. Also, you can set up social media accounts where you post interesting content to grab views and convert people into loyal customers.\\\\nIf you talk about the Zepto app, you can see how they are conscious of their marketing strategy.\\\\nThe three recent advertisements of the company had L&K Saatchi and Saatchi work on them. Apart from these three advertisements, the company also launched a few campaigns with celebrated singers such as Kailash, Usha Uthup, and Shankar Mahadevan. The campaigns were to promote their service during the Indian Premier League season of 2022.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nThere is so much to learn from everyone. You can learn from a child, peer, adult, movie, or even from one of your competitors. This blog serves as a guide to people venturing into the on-demand grocery delivery industry as it teaches them how Zepto managed to become successful in a short span.\\\\nIf one looks at the business model of Zepto, one will know how dark stores and technology (Locus) worked for them. Besides these two things, the company used the right color combination, brand name, logo, and tagline. All these things invoke the feeling of trust and optimism in people, leaving them desiring for more.\\\\nAlso, marketing, launching campaigns, giving enticements, and developing loyalty programs have helped them attain and retain customers. These can also help you if you want to launch a food delivery service.\\\\nIf you want to get an app like the Zepto, you can contact AppsRhino today to get started right away.\\\\nTable of Contents\\\\n- Introduction\\\\n- What is Zepto?\\\\n- 8 Fascinating Things You Can Learn From Zepto And Its Business Model\\\\n- Conclusion\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto, the quick commerce giant, leverages MongoDB Atlas to overcome significant scalability challenges. ‚ÄúBehind Zepto‚Äôs 10-minute delivery promise is a database built for speed!‚Äù said Sachin Chawla, VP for India & South Asia at MongoDB, in a recent social media post.\\\\nBy shifting from a monolithic architecture with relational databases to MongoDB‚Äôs NoSQL platform, Zepto reduced latency for its critical APIs by 40%. This change also boosted its ability to handle six times more traffic, improving both operational efficiency and the overall customer experience.\\\\nThe Challenge: Scaling Quick Commerce\\\\nFounded in 2021, Zepto revolutionised the Indian grocery delivery industry with its promise of 10-minute deliveries. However, as Zepto expanded‚Äîachieving $1.5 billion in annualised sales by mid-2024‚Äîits legacy infrastructure struggled to keep pace.\\\\nPerformance bottlenecks, high latency, and an inability to deliver real-time analytics hindered growth and operational efficiency.\\\\nA few months ago, during a presentation at MongoDB.local, Mayank Agarwal, senior architect at Zepto, explained: ‚ÄúWe had a big monolith, and all the components were powered by PostgreSQL and a few Redis clusters. As our business grew, we faced many performance issues and restrictions on the velocity at which we wanted to operate.‚Äù\\\\nZepto‚Äôs reliance on Redis clusters for caching also became a bottleneck as the business scaled. Kshitij Singh, technical lead at Zepto, noted, ‚ÄúWe had a pretty huge Redis setup which we wanted to get rid of, as we were not able to scale it further. MongoDB‚Äôs in-memory caching solved this problem for us.‚Äù\\\\nWhy MongoDB Atlas?\\\\nZepto sought to break its monolithic architecture into microservices and migrate to a NoSQL database to address its issues. After evaluating multiple databases, MongoDB stood out due to its ability to handle nested document structures and array-based queries effectively.\\\\n‚ÄúThe queries were very performant, given the required indexes we had created, and that gave us confidence,‚Äù said Agarwal. ‚ÄúThe biggest motivating factor was when we saw that MongoDB provides in-memory caching, which could address the huge Redis cluster that we couldn‚Äôt scale further.‚Äù\\\\nMongoDB‚Äôs Atlas platform also offered features such as real-time data archival and analytical nodes, enabling Zepto to separate customer-facing workloads from internal queries. Singh highlighted: ‚ÄúThis ensured that customer performance wasn‚Äôt compromised.‚Äù\\\\nResults: Faster, Scalable, and Reliable\\\\nZepto‚Äôs migration to MongoDB Atlas resulted in improved efficiency at an overall operational level. The company witnessed a huge reduction in latency, thereby significantly improving the response times of critical APIs and enhancing the customer experience.\\\\nAdditionally, the infrastructure scaled to handle 6x more traffic, ensuring no performance degradation.\\\\nThe migration to MongoDB also led to a 14% improvement in page load times, contributing to higher conversion rates and increased sales. MongoDB‚Äôs support for analytical nodes enabled Zepto to maintain consistent performance, ensuring effective real-time analytics across the platform.\\\\nThe shift also streamlined Zepto‚Äôs ETL pipelines and archival processes, reducing management overhead and enabling faster deployment of new features.\\\\n‚ÄúPost the migration, we observed a latency reduction of up to 40% for key APIs and handled throughput spikes, such as during campaigns, by enabling data compression and other optimisations. This has made our infrastructure more robust and scalable,‚Äù Singh said.\\\\nScaling New Heights with AWS\\\\nZepto‚Äôs success story is also powered by its strong partnership with AWS.\\\\n‚ÄúWe started Zepto about three years ago with just one dark store in Mumbai. Today, we‚Äôve grown to over 200 dark stores and annualised sales north of INR 10,000 crore,‚Äù said Kaivalya Vohra, co-founder of Zepto. ‚ÄúFrom day one, we were clear that AWS was the way to go.‚Äù\\\\nAWS‚Äô managed services and support allowed Zepto to launch new features rapidly while optimising costs. ‚ÄúAWS helped us achieve a quick MVP with credits from the AWS Activate program. As we scaled, the collaboration with AWS architects enabled us to come up with solutions no one had tried before,‚Äù noted Singh.\\\\nZepto leverages AWS across the entire customer journey, from enhancing product discovery to streamlining last-mile logistics. Generative AI solutions on AWS have also enabled faster resolution times and improved customer satisfaction.\\\\n‚ÄúAWS has been instrumental in helping us scale quickly while optimising costs. Its enterprise support and sponsorship for POCs have been invaluable,‚Äù Singh added.\\\\nThe Pricing Dilemma\\\\nZepto is currently under fire for differential pricing algorithms on Android and iPhones. Several customers have expressed their frustration on social media platforms, speculating the possible reasons behind the stark difference in prices.\\\\nSome believe the pricing is influenced by demographic and user device data, which could potentially favour Android users. The company has yet to officially comment on this issue.\\\\nüì£ Get ready for the AI event of the year‚Äîsign up for Cypher today!\\\\n                \\\\n                Introduction\\\\n‚ÄúGrocery Delivery Sector‚Äù is one of the many sectors that are expanding and succeeding at an exponential rate. Just like window shopping, you can select and buy groceries that will be delivered to you. However, most of the delivery services take almost thirty minutes to deliver the product but there is a company that delivers the groceries within 10 minutes after placing the order. That company is none other than ‚ÄúZepto.‚Äù\\\\nHave you ever wondered how Zepto delivers the order so quickly and how it gained its reputation within three years of establishment? The reason behind this success is their impactful and smart business technique. This article provides an explanation of the ‚ÄúZepto Business Model.‚Äù\\\\nThe business model of Zepto consists of three essential components-\\\\n- Working Strategy\\\\n- Marketing Strategy\\\\n- Revenue Sources\\\\nWorking Strategy\\\\nThe main objective of Zepto is to provide the best and quickest service to its customers. The efficient working strategy of Zepto is based on four pillars, namely-\\\\n1: Q- Commerce\\\\nIt stands for quick commerce. It is an instant service model of e-commerce where the marketing and dealings (buying & selling) of products & services occur on the internet. Zepto efficiently utilizes the internet to execute its business. The customers place their orders on the Zepto app and their products are delivered quickly with the help of dark store models or micro markets. It delivers various types of items like fresh produce, snacks, beverages, dry rations, cleaning items, personal care items, etc.\\\\n2: Dark Store Model\\\\nThis is the core working strategy of Zepto. The dark stores are Micro Warehouses (the physical outlets) specially installed for the distribution of the products. These are not open to visitors i.e., you cannot buy the products directly (offline) from the distribution outlets of Zepto. The dark store uses advanced AI-powered technology to perform various tasks ranging from placement of orders, packaging the products, mapping the traffic-free routes for quick delivery routes, and buying fresh grocery items from the bulk distributors. You need to place the order on the Zepto app. Thereafter, their team fulfills the orders and delivers the product to your doorstep.\\\\n3: Key Partners\\\\nThere are three key partners of Zepto- Local Stores, Financial Partners, and Delivery Partners. Zepto buys the groceries in bulk from the local stores and transfers them into the dark stores (micro warehouses). The financial partners aid in the digital payment systems for Zepto. The delivery partners help in the delivery of products from dark stores to customers.\\\\n4: Usage of AI‚ÄìPowered Technology\\\\nAI-powered technology is the key reason for the smooth working of Zepto. It utilizes location intelligence and geospatial data to determine the target population/audience, geographical location of the customers, patterns of roads, traffic dynamics (to select the roads having less traffic/crowd), supply availability (availability of the products that the customer ordered), weather conditions (for instance, heavy rainfall may disrupt the product delivery), values of the real estate (for establishing a dark store), etc.\\\\nIn short, the customers register and log in to the Zepto app and place an order. The dark store present in the nearest location of the customer receives the notification about the order of the customer. The team present in the dark store packs the item and hands it over to the delivery partner. The delivery man delivers the order to the location of the customer by using the quickest possible route. Finally, the customer receives the product and makes the payments.\\\\nMarketing Strategy\\\\nThe marketing strategy of Zepto mainly involves online Ad campaigns. The ad campaigns of Zepto are one of the best among its competitors. Their advertisements are quirky enough with the tagline of ‚Äú10-minute delivery‚Äù and ‚Äúzero delivery charges‚Äù to hit the target audience and encourage them to use Zepto app. The quick delivery of products within 10 minutes is the USP (Unique Selling Proposition) that helps it stand out among its competitors. Other than ad campaigns, Zepto uses the following marketing strategies-\\\\n- Social Media Marketing\\\\n- Influencer Marketing\\\\n- Television commercials\\\\nRevenue Sources\\\\nThe major revenue of Zepto lies in its ‚ÄúCommission Based Model‚Äù and funding rounds.\\\\n- Commissions‚Äì It receives a commission of 2-4% on each order placed through its app. These commissions help to cover the costs of the expenditures.\\\\n- Funding Rounds- It raised a significant amount of money through multiple funding rounds. As of today, the value of Zepto is around USD 900 million.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nThe impactful working and marketing strategy of Zepto has played a key role in the success of this quickest-growing startup. It works on a brilliant business model that contributes to the accomplishment of the tasks within the stipulated time. As a result, it gained broader customer reach and effectively boosts contactless shopping for customers.\\\\n                \\\\n                None\\\\n                \\\\n                International Journal of Advanced Research in Commerce, Management &Social Science (IJARCMSS) 193 \\\\nISSN :2581-7930,  Impact Factor : 6.809, Volume 05, No. 04(II), October-December,  2022, pp 193-196 \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\nJUST IN 10 MINUTES: A CASE STUDY ON ZEPTO \\\\n \\\\n Dr. Sunita Gupta\\\\uf02a \\\\nAvani Pandey** \\\\nABSTRACT \\\\n \\\\nThis case discusses the working of Zepto , an e -commerce company founded in April 2021 in \\\\nBandra, Mumbai by two 19 -year-old Stanford dropouts Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra.  Well, they are \\\\nnot newbies in the start -up world, this is their third start -up after GoPool and Kiranakart.  They came with \\\\nthis ground-breaking idea while sitting in their homes and waiting for their groceries to be delivered in 2 -3 \\\\ndays. Zepto belongs to those start -up subgroups that experienced meteoric development in the post -\\\\nCovid period. This case explains the developme nt process of how the company is making it possible to \\\\ndeliver items in 10 minutes. Zepto has raised $360 million in funding with the lead investors being the \\\\nAmerican start up accelerator company Y Combinator and the American growth equity firm Glade Broo k \\\\nCapital Partners. Currently, the company has a valuation of $900 million. 1 So, the possibility that Zepto  \\\\nwill soon turn into a unicorn is not a daft idea. However, there is a major concern surrounding Zepto‚Äô s \\\\nbusiness model as they have still not made the business profitable. Zepto is also facing tough \\\\ncompetition from its rival Blinkit (formerly known as Grofers) who was founded in December 2013. \\\\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\\\n \\\\nKeywords: Zepto, Start-up, E-commerce, Business Model, Post-Covid. \\\\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\\\n \\\\nIntroduction \\\\n Zepto is a quick e-commerce company that started its operations in 2021. \\\\n The company started its operations in Bandra, Mumbai and has subsequently extended its \\\\ndelivery areas to Pune, Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Ghaziabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata. \\\\n On October 31, 2021, a total of 8 investors, led by Glade Brook Capital Partners, invested in \\\\nthem $60 million after which more investors began to notice them. Later, they raised additional funding \\\\nthrough their series C and series D rounds. Y Combinator Continuity Fund became the major investor in \\\\nboth of these rounds. \\\\n The Series C and D rounds were held on December 20, 2021 and May 2, 2022 and raised $100 \\\\nmillion and $200 million respectively2.But Zepto is not the only quick commerce start-up that is backed by \\\\nstrong funding, it is up against fierce competition in India from Blinkit. Blinkit has received backing from \\\\n24 investor s and has gone through a total of 19 fundraising rounds. Blinkit is currently valued at $1 \\\\nbillion3. And then there is also Dunzo which is backed by Google. \\\\nZepto‚Äô s tagline is \"Groceries delivered in 10 minutes‚Äù. They do this with the help of Dark stores . \\\\nThey are nothing but warehouses that are not open to the public and are located in such area in the \\\\nneighbourhood where demand is high.Only commonly requested commodities are kept in these \\\\nwarehouses, preventing the loss of unsold stock. Zepto‚Äô s dark st ores are designed in a way so that \\\\norders are filled as rapidly as possible, effectively and efficiently reducing time. Currently, Zepto is \\\\ndelivering 2500+ goods, including food and drink, personal care products, fresh produce, home cleaning \\\\nsupplies, and  snacks and beverages, from its 100+ dark stores. As stated by the CEO of zepto  Aadit \\\\nPalicha the average delivery time taken by Zepto is 8 minutes and 47 seconds. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf02a Supervisor, Mentor &Associate Professor, Department of Commerce, Daulat Ram College, University of \\\\nDelhi, Delhi, India. \\\\n**  Student pursuing B.

The company uses artificial intelligence (AI) t o \\\\nenhance the effectiveness of its delivery network by taking into account variables like weather, traffic \\\\npatterns, population, geography, and the availability of last-mile supplies. \\\\n The co-founders have managed to make the roots of the company strong by  getting the best \\\\ntalent out there to work for them when they first started building a team.  They were successful in \\\\npersuading a number of high-profile executives from Dream 11, Amazon, Uber, Pharmeasy, and Flipkart. \\\\n(Source: LinkedIn) \\\\nThese qualified exe cutives have assisted Zepto in achieving unit economics and capital \\\\nefficiency. They are what have allowed Zepto to carve out a place for itself in the grocery‚Äôs delivery \\\\nmarket. \\\\nFindings  \\\\nGroceries account for the majority of India\\\\\\'s $1 trillion retail market.1 Consequently, this market \\\\nhas enormous potential. During Corona, it was challenging to leave the house every time you wanted to \\\\nbuy a small essential item, and today with people having to work for long hours, especially in urban cities, \\\\nit is challenging to go out and shop for daily groceries. The market needed an app like Zepto more than it \\\\nwanted one, thus its release was ideal. These apps help customers to save their time  and make their life \\\\neasier. As of right now, as mentioned by the C EO of zepto, they receive 100,000 orders each day, and \\\\ntheir demand curve is essentially flat. They once more turn to technology to determine the ideal location \\\\nfor their tiny fulfilment centres. \\\\nAlthough some would believe that Zepto‚Äô s delivery speed is what sets them apart from the \\\\ncompetition, this is not the case. The key element that sets zepto apart from its rivals is not the quickness \\\\nof the delivery men, but rather how effectively it uses technology. Zepto tracks its customers\\\\\\' spatial data, \\\\ntraffic dynamics, the time it takes to deliver the items, etc. with the aid of www.locus.sh. They collect this \\\\ndata and analyse it to decide whether they need more dark stores in the area to be able to achieve that \\\\n10-minute goal. \\\\nZepto Generates Income in Two Ways \\\\n‚Ä¢ It first negotiates a profit margin with the companies based on how much of their product is kept \\\\nin the warehouse. \\\\n‚Ä¢ Second, they make money by charging companies for ad space and the top search results. \\\\n‚Ä¢ Zepto had total revenue of INR 142.3 Cr in FY22, while incurring costs of INR 532.7 Cr. They \\\\nsuffered a loss of 390.3 Cr INR as a result. \\\\nMarketing costs make up the majority of their spending \\\\nThey invest a lot of money in promoting and advertising their app. During FY22, they spent INR \\\\n175.5 Cr, or almo st 33% of their overall expenses on marketing. In addition to this, the firm spent INR \\\\n213.2 Cr on stock -in-trade purchases in FY22. Employee benefits cost INR 50.3 Cr, while supply chain \\\\ncosts were INR 74 Cr.2 \\\\nZepto‚Äô s EBITDA margin in FY22 was -259.39%.3An EBITDA offers a clear picture of the \\\\ncompany\\\\\\'s worth and displays it to potential buyers and investors. Unfortunately, Zepto‚Äô s EBITDA is \\\\nnegative. \\\\n To distribute the products, Zepto utilizes gig workers. These individuals make an average \\\\nincome of INR 1,30,211.4 \\\\n Zepto has been able to outperform the competition because of its business model. They have a \\\\nhighly effective distribution system, and Zepto‚Äô s AI-powered tools make it simple to manage and keep an \\\\neye on inventory and product selection. This leads to better in ventory management and a wider range of \\\\nproducts. Additionally, they have a large consumer base that is constantly growing. \\\\n \\\\n1  https://www.statista.com/statistics/1021352/india-organized-retail-market-value/https://www.statista.com/topics/5615/food-retail-in \\\\nindia/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20the%20food%20and%20grocery,retail%20market%20at%2063%20percent . \\\\n2  https://www.vccircle.com/zeptounlikely-to-turn-profitable-in-near-term \\\\n3  https://inc42.com/buzz/zepto-incurs-inr-390-cr-loss-in-first-year-of-operations-fy22-sales-at-inr-\\\\n141r/#:~:text=Zepto%2C%20which%20began%20operations%20in,stood%20at%20INR%20140.7%20Cr . \\\\n4  https://www.ambitionbox.com/salaries/zepto-salaries/delivery-boy \\\\x0cDr. Sunita Gupta & Avani Pandey: Just in 10 Minutes: A Case Study on Zepto 195 \\\\nDiscussion \\\\n Zepto is indeed facing losses but it is only natural for a fledgling enterprise in their early years of \\\\noperations to incur some loss.  While Zepto has suffered losses, it is still in a better situation than Blinkit \\\\nand Dunzo, which have suffered losses of INR 1,019 Cr and INR 464 Cr respectively.1 \\\\nThe quick commerce industry has a customer base that is not very devoted, s o even if delivery \\\\ntime increases by a few minutes, customers will still go where they can obtain the best deals. \\\\n Zepto has to strike a balance between discounts and deals and keep their delivery time between \\\\n10 and 20 minutes. Blinkit is their sole main rival at the moment in this market. They need to start \\\\npenetrating into newer cities if they want to distinctly emerge as the leaders of quick commerce. \\\\nZepto has to diversify its revenue streams and stop relying solely on a limited range of sources. \\\\nAccording to the founders of Zepto, they are planning to open a Zepto caf√© that will provide popular \\\\nbrand‚Äôs coffee and tea. If it were to become a reality, it may  be successful since metropolitan city\\\\\\'s youth \\\\nrun on caffeine, and hitting up chaayos or blue tokaievery time you feel like drinking one is impractical. If \\\\nZepto wants to make this business a success, they will need more funding. Since Zepto has already \\\\nestablished a reputation for itself and everything associated with that name would benefit from its \\\\ngoodwill, their marketing costs shouldn\\\\\\'t be too high. \\\\nZepto, as well as any other rapid commerce start -up, solely receives criticism for how it treats \\\\ndelivery guys. Due to the shorter time constraints these workers must adhere to, they may drive rashly, \\\\nincreasing the chances of accidents.  Zepto, however, refutes these criticisms by pointing to their \\\\nadvanced technology, which enables the driver to arrive at the destination both securely and on time. \\\\nSWOT Analysis \\\\nStrengths \\\\n‚Ä¢ Excellent usage of technology:  With the assistance of www.locus.sh Zepto records its \\\\ncustomers\\\\\\' geographical data, traffic dynamics, delivery time, and so on. They gather and \\\\nevaluate this data to determine whether more dark establishments are needed in the region to \\\\nmeet the 10-minute objective. \\\\n‚Ä¢ Being true to their objective:  Zepto ensures that their customers\\\\\\' expectations are met by \\\\ndelivering goods in 10 minutes. Zepto achieves their ai m 90% of the time, which contributes to \\\\nbrand loyalty. \\\\n‚Ä¢ Strong financial support:  Zepto is well -funded, which allows it to expand and grow into a \\\\nmarket leader. They currently have a total funding of $360 million. \\\\n‚Ä¢ Competent Workforce: The effective management of Zepto is in the hands of highly skilled and \\\\nexperienced professionals. They are Zepto‚Äô s most valuable resource since they are well -\\\\ninformed about the market. Palicha and Vohra, the co -founders, did a fantastic job in creating \\\\ntheir team. \\\\nWeakness \\\\n‚Ä¢ Reliance on retailers: Zepto‚Äôs business strategy is primarily dependent on other businesses \\\\nand their inventory. When a retailer\\\\\\'s stock is unavailable, customers may be forced to select a \\\\nhigher-priced substitution or go without buying that item from them. \\\\n‚Ä¢ Fluctuating customer base:  To keep their clientele, Zepto must find a balance between their \\\\ndiscount strategy and keeping their delivery time under 10 minutes. \\\\n‚Ä¢ Net Income: Zepto‚Äôs operational costs are high. They need to grow their sales while decreasing  \\\\nsome of their expenditures to make their business profitable. \\\\n‚Ä¢ Nothing Unique: Zepto‚Äôs business strategy is not very unique, and any company may enter this \\\\nmarket and replicate it. \\\\n \\\\n1  https://www.vccircle.com/blinkits-marketplace-arm-s-fy22-loss-widens-to-over-rs-1-000-\\\\ncrore#:~:text=Blinkit\\\\\\'s%20marketplace%20arm\\\\\\'s%20FY22%20loss%20widens%20to%20over%20Rs%201%2C000%20crore, -\\\\nBy%20Malvika%20Maloo&text=Zomato%2Downed%20Blinkit\\\\\\'s%20marketplace%20arm,on%20transportation%2C%20contract%\\\\n20and%20advertising. \\\\nhttps://inc42.com/buzz/dunzos-loss-widens-2x-to-inr-464-cr-in-fy22-as-expenses-also-double/#:~:text=Share%20story-\\\\n,Dunzo\\\\\\'s%20Loss%20Widens%202X%20To%20INR%20464,FY22%20As%20E xpenses%20Also%20Double&text=Bengaluru%2\\\\nDbased%20hyperlocal%20delivery%20platform,due%20to%20doubling%20of%20expenses . \\\\n \\\\x0c196 International Journal of Advanced Research in Commerce, Management & Social Science (IJARCMSS)  -October-December, 2022 \\\\nOpportunity \\\\n‚Ä¢ Infiltrating further into existing locations and entering fresh  cities: One way they can \\\\noutperform their competitors is to grow their business as quickly as possible. \\\\n‚Ä¢ Various Business Ventures:  Zepto has developed a brand identity for itself, which they can \\\\nnow utilize to enter into other sectors and diversify their revenue stream. \\\\nThreats \\\\nHeavy competition: Zepto is in a league with big names. Customers swing from one app to the \\\\nnext like a pendulum. Because there is little consumer loyalty, Zepto must continually stay on top of their \\\\ngame. \\\\n Exploitation of delivery boys: There are several sceptics of the quick commerce industry. \\\\nDelivery boys are exploited in the name of quick delivery and are subjected to extreme strain, increasing \\\\nthe likelihood of an accident. \\\\nConclusion  \\\\nSince its start in April 2021, Zepto has grown organically to become one of India\\\\\\'s most valuable \\\\nand promising start -ups. Zepto has everything a successful firm requires: a talented and dedicated \\\\nworkforce, solid funding, and the use of technology to operate rapidly. However, they cannot handle huge \\\\nsales volume since the dark stores they utilise for speedy delivery are not built to support large scale \\\\noperations. They  keep a limited number of fresh items in hand because if they are not sold, they will \\\\nsuffer losses as the items stale. As a result , there is a possibility that the consumer use competitor\\\\\\'s app \\\\nsince the things they want are out of stock. \\\\nOn the face of it, if Blinkit exists& grows, it is difficult for Zepto  to be the market leader. Both \\\\nhave a nearly identical business model, and Bl inkit‚Äô s delivery time is also less than 10 minutes so \\\\nactually they both don‚Äôt have anything unique that sets them apart. The only thing that can help Zepto to \\\\ncompete with Blinkit and become a stable business firm is expanding into more cities and having  a wider \\\\nrange of products to pick from. \\\\nZepto along with other apps is effectively breaking the mould of traditional purchasing and \\\\nestablishing an e-consumerism habit. There is no doubt that Zepto is now expanding faster than anybody \\\\nelse in this sector. They are detail-oriented and employ AI-based technologies well. \\\\nZepto is expected to become a unicorn in 2023. 1However, being a unicorn does not imply that \\\\nthe firm is profitable. \\\\nIn the FY22 their revenue was considerable, as seen by the number of orders they received \\\\neach day, but their operational costs were high and  hence they suffered losses. If they want to become a \\\\nprofitable firm, they must expand into newer cities while adhering to their basic principles and finding \\\\nmethods to reduce their operational expenses. \\\\nReferences  \\\\n1. https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto/news \\\\n2. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto \\\\n3. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zepto-29b1 \\\\n4. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/grofers-trusted-delivery-partner \\\\n5.

Representatives from several prominent investment firms, including Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Temasek, GIC, and Invesco, were among the attendees, according to materials reviewed by TechCrunch.\\\\nThe spokesperson for the firm declined to comment when reached earlier on Tuesday.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs annualized sales run rate recently exceeded $1.5 billion, Palicha told them, adding that a growth rate of approximately 150% would push its sales to more than $3.5 billion. Zepto competes with Zomato‚Äôs Blinkit, SoftBank-backed Swiggy Instamart, and BigBasket, all of them wooing customers with their 10- to 15-minute delivery services. Blinkit‚Äôs current run rate stands at about $2 billion.\\\\nQuick commerce is rapidly gaining traction in India‚Äôs $1.1 trillion unorganized retail market. Zepto, Blinkit, Swiggy, and Tata-owned BigBasket‚Äôs BB Now are collectively on track to clock annual sales exceeding $6 billion, compared to overall e-commerce sales of approximately $50 billion. Online grocer BigBasket, which delivers groceries to customers within a few hours, said Tuesday it is making a complete pivot to quick commerce.\\\\nThe Indian e-commerce market, dominated by Flipkart and Amazon India, is growing at about 11% to 12% annually, according to industry figures. In contrast, quick commerce has grown more than 100% in each of the last three years.\\\\nQuick-commerce firms are ‚Äúclearly taking share‚Äù from larger e-commerce companies, said Rahul Malhotra, an e-commerce analyst at Bernstein. Quick commerce ‚Äúmay account for 40-50% of e-comm (some categories) over the next three years as per our checks, currently accounts for 10-15% of the total e-comm segment,‚Äù Elara Capital said in a note.\\\\nE-commerce giants are taking note. Flipkart launched its quick-commerce offering, called Flipkart Minutes, earlier this month. Amazon India, long a skeptic of the model, is also eyeing launching its own quick-commerce service as early as the first quarter next year, Indian newspaper Economic Times reported Wednesday.\\\\nInvestors on Tuesday‚Äôs call questioned Palicha about the potential for quick commerce to expand beyond India‚Äôs top dozen or so cities, as these apps currently operate primarily in major urban areas. ‚ÄúQuick commerce is not a Tier 1 phenomenon,‚Äù Palicha said. ‚ÄúOur data points clearly to a huge opportunity in tier 2/3, regardless of the market sentiment.‚Äù\\\\nHe also confirmed during the call that Zepto has raised $1 billion in the past 90 days, a war chest he said will allow the firm to more aggressively expand. Zepto counts Nexus Venture Partners, Lightspeed, Avra, YC Continuity, Contrary and StepStone Group among its backers.\\\\nTechCrunch had earlier reported that Zepto, now valued at $5 billion, was finalizing a $340 million funding round led by General Catalyst. The startup closed a $665 million funding round in June.\\\\nUpdate: On August 30, Zepto confirmed it has raised $340 million in a follow-on round. General Catalyst led the round with participation from new investors Mars Growth Capital (Dragon Fund) and Epiq Capital.\\\\n‚ÄúI‚Äôve known Aadit and Kaivalya for several years, and they are truly exceptional founders who turned their bold mission to modernise India‚Äôs grocery sector into a category-defining company. This is just the beginning of their journey,‚Äù said Neeraj Arora, Managing Director of General Catalyst, in a statement. ‚ÄúThis is one of our first investments in India following the merger of Venture Highway and General Catalyst. We are thrilled to partner with Zepto, and believe their quick commerce model is setting the standard for the future of e-commerce in India and beyond.‚Äù\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto Nears $4B Annualized GOV, Reduces Burn Rate by 50% Amid Profit Push\\\\nZepto, one of India‚Äôs fastest-growing quick commerce startups, is getting closer to a significant milestone, with its Annualized Gross Order Value (GOV) approaching $4 billion. This represents an impressive ~300% year-on-year growth and a ~30% increase since January 2025, according to co-founder and CEO Aadit Palicha.\\\\nIn a LinkedIn post on April 9, 2025, Palicha shared that, ‚ÄúZepto is getting close to $4B in Annualized GOV, which represents ~300% year-on-year growth (and ~30% growth since my last update in January).‚Äù\\\\nWhat makes this growth even more noteworthy is that it comes alongside improved financial discipline. Palicha noted that Zepto has reduced its EBITDA (excluding ESOPs) and operating cash flow (OCF) burn by 50% over the past three months, even as the company continued to scale meaningfully.\\\\nHe also expressed confidence that Zepto is within touching distance of breakeven on both EBITDA (excluding ESOPs) and OCF in the coming months, adding that the company still maintain a large net cash buffer on its balance sheet.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs dark store model continues to show strong promise. ‚ÄúOur newly launched dark stores continue to track towards EBITDA breakeven, just as the dark stores we launched over the last 3 years did in our previous store expansion cycles,‚Äù Palicha shared.\\\\nPalicha also clarified Zepto‚Äôs definition of GOV, which includes fruits and vegetables at selling price and ancillary revenue streams, such as subscriptions and advertising.\\\\nFounded in 2021 by Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, Zepto has grown rapidly in India‚Äôs quick commerce sector. Backed by increasing order volumes, tighter cost controls, and a sizable cash reserve, the company is actively working toward achieving profitability, an uncommon development in the current startup environment.\\\\nMust have tools for startups - Recommended by StartupTalky\\\\n- Convert Visitors into Leads- SeizeLead\\\\n- Website Builder SquareSpace\\\\n- Manage your business Smoothly Google Business Suite\\\\n                \\\\n                One of the top rapid commerce companies in India, Zepto, is making waves once more as it moves into advanced talks to finance $100‚Äì150 million from Motilal Oswal and many Indian family offices and high-net-worth individuals (HNIs). Following many significant investments over the previous several months, the company has raised additional capital to further establish itself as a major player in the fiercely competitive fast delivery market.\\\\nCredits: The Hindu Business Line\\\\nMotilal Oswal Leading the Charge\\\\nMotilal Oswal, a prominent financial services firm, is expected to invest $40 million into Zepto. Of this, Raamdeo Agrawal, the chairman and co-founder of Motilal Oswal, is set to personally contribute $15 million, according to those close to the matter. Agrawal is already an existing investor in Zepto and is now looking to further increase his stake in the rapidly growing company.\\\\nThe discussions have reportedly been ongoing for the last three months, and the deal is expected to close soon. In addition to Motilal Oswal‚Äôs direct investment, the firm is also helping facilitate another $60-110 million from various Indian family offices and HNIs. If successful, the round would inject significant capital into Zepto at a time when the quick commerce sector is fiercely contested by established giants.\\\\nCredits: Money Control\\\\nA Cash Chest to Compete with Industry Majors\\\\nZepto‚Äôs ability to raise such large sums of capital in a short span underscores the growing investor confidence in the quick commerce model. As traditional retailers like DMart begin to feel the pressure from rapid delivery services, Zepto is preparing to compete head-to-head with well-established names in the space.\\\\nThis funding would be Zepto‚Äôs third major round in less than four months, signaling its aggressive growth strategy as it races toward an IPO. The additional funds would allow Zepto to expand its operations, improve its infrastructure, and keep pace with competitors like Zomato‚Äôs Blinkit, IPO-bound Swiggy, Flipkart Minutes, and Tata‚Äôs BigBasket, all of whom are vying for dominance in the 10-20 minute delivery space.\\\\nThe Race for Market Dominance\\\\nZepto would benefit greatly from its most recent capital infusion, which would allow it to scale more quickly and firmly establish its market position as the competition in the quick commerce space heats up. By providing customers with the ease of almost instantaneous delivery, rapid delivery startups are upending traditional grocery retail. This approach has proven particularly popular in densely populated urban regions.\\\\nThe market is far from simple, though. Competing businesses are also stepping up their initiatives. Zomato‚Äôs Blinkit has the support of a publicly traded firm, while Swiggy‚Äôs Instamart is gearing up for an initial public offering. The market is now more competitive than ever because to the aggressive expansion of BigBasket‚Äôs rapid delivery division, Flipkart Minutes, and the latter‚Äôs quick commerce service.\\\\nFor Zepto, maintaining its $5 billion valuation while raising fresh capital demonstrates its ability to attract high-level investors and its growth potential. The influx of funds will also enable Zepto to invest in technology, improve logistics, and expand its delivery network across more cities in India.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs Meteoric Rise\\\\nZepto‚Äôs fundraising success is nothing short of impressive. The company, which was founded just three years ago, has rapidly ascended in the crowded quick commerce market. It first made waves in June 2024 when it raised $665 million at a valuation of $3.6 billion. Barely two months later, it secured an additional $340 million, pushing its valuation to $5 billion.\\\\nZepto has raised $1.6 billion in total so far, more than $1 billion of which has been raised in the last four months alone. This amount of money shows that investors believe Zepto‚Äôs business strategy, which depends on providing clients with necessities in a matter of minutes, has long-term promise.\\\\nCompanies such as Zepto are placing their bets on the notion that convenience and speed will turn into the distinguishing characteristics of future retail experiences, as the rapid commerce industry continues to develop. Zepto intends to address the rising demand for prompt, dependable delivery by expanding its network of dark stores‚Äîsmall warehouses designed for quick order fulfillment‚Äîand acquiring a cutting-edge logistics infrastructure.\\\\n                \\\\n                Mumbai-based quick commerce startup Zepto is reportedly in advanced discussions to secure $100-million in a funding round, its third major investment round in the past six months. The company aims to raise the capital from Indian family offices and high-net-worth individuals (HNIs), according to sources familiar with the matter.\\\\nAsset management firm Motilal Oswal, which previously invested $40 million in Zepto, is said to be managing the funding mandate. According to sources, Motilal Oswal is investing around $40 million and facilitating an additional $100 million from Indian family offices and other HNIs. Raamdeo Agrawal, chairman and co-founder of Motilal Oswal, is expected to contribute around $15 million in his personal capacity out of the $40 million investment. Agrawal is already an investor in Zepto. ‚ÄúCommitment for about $100 has been received, but the round could go upto $150 million or further,‚Äù said a person aware of the developments.\\\\nTalks have been ongoing for about three months and are expected to materialise soon. The new investment is anticipated to value Zepto at a post-money valuation of $5 billion, consistent with its recent $340 million financing round in August. The aim is to increase domestic ownership ahead of the company‚Äôs planned initial public offering (IPO) next year, sources said.\\\\nThe company, which popularised ultra fast deliveries of groceries within 10 minutes, has raised approximately $1.6 billion since its inception three years ago. Over $1 billion of this has been secured in the past four months alone. Zepto is also expanding into traditional e-commerce and retail categories like fashion and electronics.\\\\nIt raised $665 million at a valuation of $3.6 billion in June and secured another $340 million at a $5 billion valuation in August.\\\\nInitially based in Singapore, Zepto shifted its headquarters to Mumbai to prepare for public listing. The company is currently in the middle of another shift, this time to Bengaluru, which is expected to complete by mid-November, according to sources.\\\\nZepto has appointed Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Axis Capital as investment bankers for the IPO and is in the process of finalising additional advisors.\\\\nZepto competes directly with other quick commerce players such as Zomato-owned Blinkit, Prosus-backed Swiggy‚Äôs Instamart, and Tata‚Äôs BigBasket. The quick commerce sector in India is experiencing robust expansion, with projected sales exceeding $6 billion this year. This surge has prompted traditional e-commerce companies like Flipkart, Myntra and Nykaa to accelerate their delivery times to remain competitive.\\\\nThe rise of quick commerce is impacting traditional retailers as well. Shares of D-Mart‚Äôs parent company fell this week after the firm acknowledged losing some business to quick commerce startups. Analysts noted that these startups are expanding cities, categories, creating parallel commerce for convenience-seeking customers.\\\\nZepto claims it has increased its annualised net revenue run rate in recent months. In a meeting with investors in August, co-founder and CEO Aadit Palicha projected that the company would grow by 150% over the next 12 months.\\\\nZepto did not immediately respond to requests for comments.\\\\n                \\\\n                D2CX by Inc42 is a 12-week hands-on program to help you level up your D2C game.

Learn from India‚Äôs top 1% of D2C founders & experts through actionable insights, proven strategies and tactics on how to launch a successful D2C Brand in 6 weeks.\\\\nview\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto, a newcomer to the quick-commerce scene, is starting a big project to raise a lot of money from international investors. This calculated move highlights Zepto‚Äôs resolve to broaden its reach and challenge industry titans. Let‚Äôs investigate the possible effects of Zepto‚Äôs audacious expansion proposal.\\\\nCredits: The Arc\\\\nZepto‚Äôs Unique Position:\\\\nZepto is unique in the competitive quick-commerce market because it is the only independently owned and venture-backed business. Zepto‚Äôs independence gives it the agility and flexibility to quickly adjust to changes in the market, unlike its competitors who are controlled by larger corporations. Zepto has a competitive edge as it negotiates the potential and challenges in the ever changing quick-commerce industry thanks to its distinctive position.\\\\nNavigating the Competitive Landscape:\\\\nZepto is unique in a field crowded with well-established competitors supported by big businesses, being the only independent startup with venture capital funding. Zepto‚Äôs distinct positioning gives it a competitive advantage in the quick-commerce space and enables it to respond quickly to market developments.\\\\nMeeting Surging Consumer Demand:\\\\nThe choice to seek at least $300 million in finance is highly appropriate given the current upsurge in consumer demand in the quick-commerce sector, particularly for same-day grocery delivery. Zepto wants to take advantage of this trend by strengthening its service offerings and expanding its infrastructure to better serve its clients‚Äô changing needs.\\\\nChallenging the Titans:\\\\nZepto faces a formidable challenge from industry giants like Instamart, Blinkit, and BigBasket, which boast substantial resources and corporate backing. To level the playing field, Zepto seeks investors capable of leading multiple funding rounds, empowering it to scale up operations and compete more effectively in the cutthroat quick-commerce arena.\\\\nFinancial Performance and Strategic Growth:\\\\nDespite encountering hurdles, Zepto has showcased remarkable operational efficiency and a notable reduction in EBITDA losses over a relatively short period. With a sharp improvement in its EBITDA margin and plans to achieve break-even soon, Zepto is primed for sustainable growth and profitability.\\\\nDiversification for Market Dominance:\\\\nZepto‚Äôs expansion beyond grocery delivery into product categories like apparel, gifting, and baby care reflects a strategic move to diversify its revenue streams. By mirroring its competitors‚Äô approach and tapping into segments with higher consumer spending, Zepto aims to capture a larger market share and foster enhanced customer loyalty.\\\\nInnovative Customer Engagement:\\\\nThe launch of Zepto Pass, a membership program with remarkable initial adoption, highlights Zepto‚Äôs dedication to innovation and customer-focused business practices. Zepto Pass, which is competitively priced and provides a plethora of perks, is positioned to increase customer retention and develop recurring income streams, making Zepto a leader in the quickly changing quick-commerce space.\\\\nStrategic Brand Building:\\\\nRecognizing the pivotal role of brand building and customer loyalty in a fiercely competitive environment, Zepto has allocated resources towards marketing endeavors. By cultivating a robust brand identity and nurturing customer trust, Zepto endeavors to carve out a distinct niche in the market, setting itself apart from the competition and cultivating a dedicated customer base.\\\\nNavigating Industry Dynamics:\\\\nThe growing popularity of Zepto among businesses such as Blinkit and Instamart suggests a shift in the perception of profitability in the quick-commerce sector‚Äîan industry marked by both triumphs and setbacks. But as e-commerce giants like Flipkart and Amazon approach, competition is set to increase, pushing businesses to innovate and adjust to shifting market conditions.\\\\nConclusion:\\\\nIn summary, Zepto‚Äôs aggressive quest for significant funds marks the beginning of a new phase in its endeavor to upend the quick-commerce industry. Zepto is well-positioned for rapid expansion and market leadership with a strong emphasis on customer involvement, product variety, and operational efficiency. Redefining the future of quick-commerce is Zepto‚Äôs unwavering dedication as it navigates the opportunities and challenges ahead. Zepto‚Äôs ambitious goals are a tribute to its unyielding commitment and pioneering spirit in molding the developing narrative of India‚Äôs burgeoning quick-commerce ecosystem, as investors and customers alike wait with bated breath.\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto seeks $300M in fresh funding at nearly $3B valuation\\\\nWhat\\\\\\'s the story\\\\nMumbai-based quick commerce start-up Zepto is reportedly in early-stage discussions for a funding round that could potentially raise at least $300 million from international investors.\\\\nThe company, which achieved unicorn status last year with a valuation of $1.4 billion, is now aiming for a valuation between $2.5 and $3 billion based on current market multiples.\\\\nThis prospective funding round is expected to strengthen Zepto\\\\\\'s financial standing and enhance its competitive edge against market leaders like Zomato-owned Blinkit and Swiggy Instamart.\\\\nFinancial goals\\\\nZepto strives for EBITDA positivity by September\\\\nRecent investor presentations reveal that Zepto is working toward becoming EBITDA positive by September.\\\\nCurrently, the company\\\\\\'s annual gross sales run-rate stands at a remarkable $1.2 billion.\\\\nThe Economic Times quoted an insider as saying, \"Zepto is working toward achieving its EBITDA positive target ahead of schedule.\"\\\\nThis could improve the company\\\\\\'s standing in the forthcoming funding round.\\\\nGrowth strategy\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s expansion plans and e-commerce objectives\\\\nDespite achieving a gross sales run rate of $1 billion last month, Zepto has declined a term sheet from at least one growth stage fund.\\\\nThe company has ambitious plans for expansion and broader ecommerce objectives.\\\\n\"Zepto is certainly considering a new funding round and has significant plans regarding the total amount to be raised,\" The Economic Times reported, quoting a source familiar with the developments.\\\\nCEO statement\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s CEO clarifies funding position amid expansion\\\\nDespite the fundraising discussions, Aadit Palicha, co-founder and CEO of Zepto, clarified that the company is not actively seeking funds and there are no ongoing discussions with investors.\\\\n\"We concluded a substantial funding round just a few months ago and are on the brink of achieving EBITDA positivity, so our focus is on strong execution rather than raising capital,\" Palicha stated.\\\\nBusiness expansion\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s remarkable growth and future plans\\\\nPalicha highlighted Zepto\\\\\\'s impressive growth, stating, \"We are growing at a rate of 140% year-on-year, and our mature stores are now generating 6-7% of EBITDA, a figure that could rise to 13-14%. Hence, these stores can generate their own cash.\"\\\\nSince its last funding round in October, Zepto\\\\\\'s business has expanded by over 100%, and its EBITDA has improved by 6%.\\\\nZepto now plans to broaden its product range to include categories such as fashion, jewelry, toys, beauty, and electronics.\\\\n                \\\\n                Quick commerce platform Zepto is planning to raise another $310 million in funding at a valuation of $5 billion. This is as per an Economic Times report. This valuation would be a 40 percent jump from the firm‚Äôs latest valuation.\\\\nOn June 21, Zepto raised $665 million in a funding round. At that time, the start-up was valued at $3.6 billion. Avenir Growth Capital, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Avra Capital, and Andreessen Horowitz investor Anu Hariharan were some of the investors who participated in the funding round.\\\\nAfter the last fundraise, Zepto co-founder Aadit Palicha reportedly said, ‚ÄúWe have executed fairly well and are the fastest-growing Indian company to hit a billion dollars in GMV (gross merchandise value) terms, and we continue to grow at over 100% year-on-year. If we did not execute, we would not have been able to successfully get this financing.‚Äù\\\\nAdditionally, the company raised $200 million in August last year at a valuation of $1.4 billion. Investors, including StepStone Group, Goodwater Capital, Nexus Venture Partners, and GladeBrook Capital, participated in the funding round.\\\\nSpeaking about the company\\\\\\'s upcoming fundraise, a source told the Economic Times, ‚ÄúThe term sheet was signed Friday, and it should close in a couple of weeks. Mars Growth is investing about $50 million, while General Catalyst is investing around $200 million and the rest from others.‚Äù\\\\nMars Growth Capital, a venture co-managed by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. and Israel‚Äôs Liquidity Group, will reportedly join the new fundraise. US-based General Catalyst and other current investors will reportedly join the fundraise.\\\\nThe quick commerce platform is also planning to shift its base from Mumbai to Bengaluru. This shift will help the company save around Rs 40‚Äì50 lakh in rent per month. Speaking about the move, an employee told Business Standard, ‚ÄúHalf of the technology team was already in Bengaluru, while most of the product and marketing teams are in Mumbai. The company wants the product and technology teams to work together out of a single office space.‚Äù\\\\nThe quick commerce industry has been increasing in India. Redseer Strategy Consultants predicts that the industry, which currently has a $2.8 billion market size, will grow to be a disruptive force that will completely change the retail sector.\\\\nPlatforms such as Blinkit and Instagram are focusing on their expansion plans. Zomato-owned Blinkit is planning to have around 1,000 dark stores by FY25 end. Zepto is also planning to set up around 700 dark stores by March 2025. Amid the intensifying competition, new players such as Flipkart and Reliance are also joining the race.\\\\n                \\\\n                Updated October 17th 2024, 15:24 IST\\\\nZepto , a player in India‚Äôs quick commerce sector, is in advanced discussions to secure $100 million in fresh investment. This marks the third round of funding for the Mumbai-based startup in the past six months, as it aims to attract more domestic investors, according to media reports.\\\\nThe startup specialises in delivering grocery items and office supplies to customers within a 10-minute window across various Indian cities. The new capital is expected to come from Indian family offices and high-net-worth individuals.\\\\nMotilal Oswal, an asset management firm that previously invested $40 million in Zepto, is overseeing the fundraising efforts. Notably, more than half of the funding allocation has already been secured.\\\\nThis upcoming investment is set to value Zepto at $5 billion post-money, matching its valuation during a recent $340 million financing round concluded in August. Over the last six months, Zepto has successfully raised over $1 billion, all of which remains in its accounts.\\\\nLooking ahead, Zepto plans to go public next year and is keen on expanding its roster of domestic investors. Current backers include Avra, Lightspeed, Nexus, StepStone Group, YC Continuity, Glade Brook, and Contrary.\\\\nZepto, which competes with Zomato -owned BlinkIt, Prosus-backed Swiggy ‚Äôs Instamart, and Tata‚Äôs BigBasket, has significantly increased its annualised net run rate in recent months.

Therefore, how can the delivery sector lag? The delivery sector is going through a lot of changes every day. Different delivery apps and startups are bringing in other methods.\\\\nIn this blog today, we will discuss the marketing strategy of Zepto ‚Äì one of the most prominent grocery delivery apps of the present time. The best part of Zepto marketing strategy is the 10-minute guarantee delivery. As a result, you can get groceries delivered to your doorstep that you previously purchased from the local general store.\\\\nWhat is Zepto? What Types of Companies Comes Under the Zepto Marketing Strategy?\\\\nZepto offers service only through the official application. At present, it has more than 80 dark stores throughout the country. These stores are primarily in tier one cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, and more. Zepto is a pan-India company that started its operations in April 2021. However, it was founded in September 2020.\\\\nThe primary reason Zepto has a successful business model in India is that Zepto marketing strategy includes producing 2500+ goods within 10 minutes. As a result, it was impossible for any top delivery or e-commerce sites.\\\\nWhether it is the marketing strategy of Zepto or any other marketing strategy, there are a lot of crucial factors. The idea is one of the most important ones of them. The Story of Zepto starts when the two founders, who were studying computer science, got tempted with their creative idea to start a business.\\\\nWith the idea to deliver food to your doorsteps in the least possible time, Zepto was introduced. The most crucial thing was that Zepto was introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the strict lockdown, when people were striving hard to get out of their homes, the founders worked hard to make the delivery possible even during the restrictions.\\\\nHow does Zepto Delivery Work? A Detail on Zepto Business Model\\\\nThe Zepto business model was inspired by the idea on which KiranaKart depends. KiranaKart depends on is for the local shopkeepers and managers. They deliver the goods and products within 45 minutes of placing the order. Zepto marketing strategy is based on similar ideas. Both the founders were bachelors, and they had to struggle a lot to get food delivered. This is where they got the idea of creating such an app that quickly provides grocery items.\\\\nAlso Read: 8 Compelling Reasons to Invest in a Grocery App Development Company\\\\nTheir vision is to open Zepto Dark stores all over India and expand the brand at the top level. They are planning to increase the team from 400 to 800 by 2023. You must think that Zepto app is the only company to be the fastest delivery online shopping app. At the same time, they are facing intense competition from rival companies like Swiggy, Zomato, Blinkit and Dunzo. The best part is all the competitors are offering the same service at equal rates.\\\\nTherefore, it was not easy to stay in the top place. Zepto marketing strategy required more business skills and investment to be the fastest delivery app in India. They introduced new standards to transform their work in the delivery infrastructure ‚Äì right from the basic level. In simple words, ground-level work was still needed.\\\\nFunding & Investment for Zepto Marketing Strategy\\\\nThe leading sources for Zepto‚Äôs funds are Y combinator community funds and Glade brook capital partners. Both invested 100 million dollars and 4.4 billion rupees, respectively. Zepto has a successful business model in India, showing continuous growth. You can see the Zepto marketing strategy‚Äôs success from the number of stores they have opened across cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune and more.\\\\nAs the fastest delivery app in India, Zepto delivers grocery items only in the stores‚Äô available areas. The technical office is in Bangalore. This is where all the technicalities are handled, while the operations are done from the Mumbai office. So, if you ask if the supermarket business is profitable in India, we will say YES. Why? Popular apps like Flipkart, Uber, Dream11 and more have their key executives in the Zepto app. Recently, Lazypay and Pescafresh partnered with Zepto.\\\\nZepto Talent Acquisition\\\\nAnother important thing that has worked in favour of a successful Zepto marketing strategy is acquiring talent. Top executives decided to join Zepto because it allowed so many people that had shifted to Bangalore to come back to Mumbai. However, the fast growth of the start-up, its ambition and the disciplined execution encouraged several people to be attracted to the company.\\\\nOrder Volume Claims\\\\nBlinkit & Instamart claimed that their weekly order volume increased to more than a million. So, the question is, what about Zepto? How many orders are they delivering now? Well, Zepto is not too keen to publish the numbers. However, they are saying that with the current numbers, they shall easily surpass the competitors in the market.\\\\nZepto Business Model: Dark Store Model\\\\nDark stores might seem a sinister option, but it is a great idea that helped multiple retail businesses stay afloat throughout the pandemic. The dark stores are distribution outlets that are not open to visitors. These are micro warehouses that quickly and accurately fulfil orders. Therefore, they offer shoppers resources and options like buying products online, pickup in-store and same-day delivery.\\\\nAccording to the founders and shareholders of the Zepto app, the magic of the dark store model is how they became the fastest delivery app in India. With the help of the dark stores, they could pick, pack, and dispatch the goods within 60 seconds. However, the last section is just like any other delivery model.\\\\nSuch a grocery delivery model is implemented in developed nations; however, the model was never explored in India. The dark store model reduces the trivial challenges that any delivery service faces. These include navigation, traffic congestion, and connectivity.\\\\nZepto marketing strategy used geography, location intelligence, population, road patterns, traffic dynamics, last-minute supply availability, weather, real estate values and others. All these factors improved the network‚Äôs overall performance.\\\\nDark stores are meant for instant deliveries and can‚Äôt handle the sales volume. However, the Zepto grocery app didn‚Äôt compromise on the shortcomings of this model. They have thousands of products on display, fresh produce, meat, milk, kitchen refills and more at the best bargain. Also, the AI-powered tool ensures a smooth transition, right from picking, packing, and delivering. All these features make the Zepto grocery app the fastest online shopping app.\\\\nBenefits of Zepto Business Model\\\\nThere are a lot of benefits to the Zepto Business Model. In the following section of the blog, we shall mention a few.\\\\n1. Better Distribution & Faster Delivery\\\\nThe dark store enables Zepto to fulfill orders quickly and more efficiently. In addition, the micro and cold warehouses offer several distribution choices and bring groceries closer to a particular market segment. Thus, you can see that Zepto has higher control over the market spread and distribution. It is another reason why Zepto is the fastest delivery app in India.\\\\n2. Better and Broader Customer Reach\\\\nOne of the dark stores‚Äô most important features is bringing the distribution centres close to the consumers. The best thing about these stores is they are always online to take orders. It is what brings consumers to such platforms and uses their services. Therefore, it is one of the essential features that made the successful Zepto marketing strategy.\\\\n3. Contactless Shopping\\\\nThere is no denying the fact that the need for contact-free shopping is a critical factor for businesses to adopt the ‚Äúdark store‚Äù approach. The dark stores allow consumers to purchase groceries in a contactless way without entering a physical store. All you must do is place orders, and you will get them instantly.\\\\n4. Better Inventory Control and Product Assortment\\\\nZepto‚Äôs business model and Zepto marketing strategy worked because they chose dark stores. The dark stores are customer-free zones, and they have better control over the inventory. Therefore, they can easily manage larger order volumes. In addition, the dark stores are designed to ensure easy navigation, allowing the packers to move quickly to pack the items in an order. Also, the AI-powered tools keep the inventory stock track and provide product assortment.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs USP\\\\nZepto‚Äôs business model is customer-centric, and it is an instant delivery model. However, Zepto offers a few selling points that set it apart from its competitors. Still, these are also included in the model.\\\\nOne of the main reasons the Zepto app is the fastest online shopping app is because Zepto has instant delivery and is regarded as quick commerce. They are capable enough to fulfill the grocery delivery in 10 minutes. Also, they claim to have a delivery time of 8 minutes and 47 seconds.\\\\nAccording to the founders, when a user checks the order, it is already shipped out for delivery. Therefore, it is another essential element that makes Zepto marketing strategy successful. They fulfill almost every order within 10 minutes. Only one percent of the charges might take 15-16 minutes.\\\\nAnother crucial factor for successful business models in India is to offer free shipping. Zepto offers free shipping. Even though this USP has got dim compared to the former one, it still doesn‚Äôt charge a delivery fee. On the other hand, Amazon Fresh & Instacart have delivery fees.\\\\nYou must remember that the free service doesn‚Äôt mean costlier products. Yet another USP is that it offers excellent discounts on its list of products and groceries.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs Online Ad Campaigns\\\\nZepto marketing campaigns are one of the best ones you shall see in the ad campaigns of recent companies. Zepto witnessed growth primarily because of its unique ad campaigns online. All of this they achieved in a short time. Did you know? L&K Saatchi & Saatchi was behind 3 of Zepto‚Äôs recent ads.\\\\nThe idea behind all Zepto‚Äôs ad campaigns is that time is an expandable commodity in India. Therefore, you cannot afford to waste it. Whether you must board a flight or wait for the food at a restaurant, we all have experienced stretchable time. It is where Zepto ad campaigns have stood apart.\\\\nHere are examples of the Zepto marketing strategy ad campaign where they surprisingly used three famous singers. Usha Uthup, Shankar Mahadevan & Kailash Kher are cast in unusual roles where they must stretch time in their way ‚Äì thus highlighting the objective of Zepto, which is on-time delivery.\\\\nThe ad campaigns have paved the way for the Zepto app to be the most talked about brand.\\\\nHere‚Äôs What Zepto‚Äôs Chief Marketing Officer has to Say\\\\nAmritansu Nanda, Chief Marketing Officer of Zepto, says, ‚ÄúOur consumers lead busy, fast-paced lives. At Zepto, through our on-time delivery promise and at the back of our exceptional tech, we constantly strive to let them know and reassure them that we value their time. This campaign, featuring some of the most iconic pop-culture voices of the country, brings alive our proposition of quick delivery and strikes the right chord with our core TG through relatable entertainment. It is also a critical milestone in our journey towards becoming synonymous with quick-commerce in India.‚Äù\\\\nKartik Smetacek, Jt NCD, L&K Saatchi, and Saatchi added, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs often said clients get the work they deserve. Zepto is a case in point. From scripting these to presenting them to producing them, working on the campaign was an absolute pleasure, with the agency and client working as one team completely committed to the product. I think the results speak for themselves.\\\\nIn Conclusion\\\\nZepto marketing strategy has helped the brand to grow as the fastest delivery app in India. Zepto app has plans to expand into newer cities as quickly as possible. They are also planning to increase their coverage to micro-markets and be the leaders in the sector. Several other competitors are trying to participate in the market and grow quickly. However, they cannot promise things like 10-minute delivery consistently. Zepto is a detail-oriented and intense business with technical and operating discipline that allows them to ensure the 10-minute delivery.\\\\nShyam Future Tech LLP ‚Äì the ISO 27001:2013 & 9001:2015 certified IT venture of Shyam Steel Industries Ltd., digitally empowers all sorts of businesses of every scale.

So you would go to Zepto, choose all the items you want to order, pay for it and get it in under 10 minutes.\\\\nBut here‚Äôs everything Zepto has to do to get those product to your home in under 10 mins ‚è¨\\\\nRent a warehouse and assemble their dark store\\\\nHire delivery executives to deliver your order\\\\nHire folks to handle all the packing, arranging & all other operational tasks inside the warehouse\\\\nHire folks to handle support when things don‚Äôt go as planned\\\\nSpeak to local suppliers to get the groceries and other supplies to their dark store\\\\nBuild an app to display all the items for the customers\\\\nSpeak to UPI aggregators, banks & other financial institutions to setup seamless payment systems for you\\\\nBuild in-house systems to communicate your order to the operational staff\\\\nBuild in-house systems to help the delivery executive pickup orders and deliver them safely\\\\n& so much more‚Ä¶.\\\\nWhatever you see on your smartphone is only possible because of a ton of moving parts that seem to be seamlessly fixed with each other. This is the very simple answer to Zepto‚Äôs Business Model ü§üüèº\\\\nTo understand the complex version of Zepto‚Äôs business model, you can jump to the relevant section using the quick links below\\\\nTo breakdown this craziness behind the 10 min delivery, our team downloaded Zepto and made a quick order. We made sure that the order contained a mix of meat, fruits & milk (their highest margin items). Zepto delivered this order in less than 13 minutes!\\\\nWe also looked at a ton of user interviews and founder interviews on YouTube to understand the Zepto business model in depth.\\\\nEverything you see here is a result of mix of original research gathered from the internet and the users of Zepto. Here are the 5 key pieces that allow Zepto to deliver your order in 10 minutes or less!\\\\n1. Darkstores & Microwarehouses:\\\\nDarkstores are physical warehouses where all the items you see on the Zepto app are placed in. When you order anything, a Zepto delivery executive picks up all your items from one of these dark stores and brings it to you.\\\\nUnlike traditional retail stores, you cannot go to a dark store and buy your grocery items. Dark stores can only be accessed by Zepto‚Äôs team members and their vendors.\\\\nDark stores are the sole reason why Zepto is able to deliver some orders in under 10 minutes. By being in close proximity to a dense urban are, they are able to deliver your order quickly.\\\\nFor example, let‚Äôs consider Indiranagar in Bangalore.\\\\nBy placing a warehouse in this location, Zepto will be able to service all these neighbourhoods in under 10 minutes.\\\\nIf the order frequency and retention is good, the dark stores will max out almost instantly. Then they could either add more deliver partners to the same dark store or simplu open up one more dark store nearby!\\\\nWhat happens if that dark store also reaches a bottleneck?\\\\nIn that case, Zepto opens up another dark store to meet demands.\\\\nBut thanks to their experienced leadership team, all these expansion decisions are backed by data. They take into account geography, future growth potential, traffic, weather, driver availability & much more before they even think about opening a new dark store.\\\\n2. Super Quick Packaging\\\\nThe founding principles of Zepto has always been impeccable operations backed by custom built software. That‚Äôs how they scaled their first store and that‚Äôs the same principle they‚Äôre using for all their stores across India.\\\\nOnce you place an order, an operations executive inside their warehouse will get two things\\\\nA list of all the items in your orders\\\\nA map to navigate themselves inside the warehouse to pickup all the items in the least amount of time\\\\nThe second point is what truly allows Zepto to become a kingpin on operational efficiency üöÄ. As their CTO Kaivalya Arora says, ‚ÄòWe have designed the process to make sure the entire order is dispacted in 60 - 90 seconds‚Äô\\\\nThis means that the rest of the time is entirely spent on the last mile delivery, thereby easing some pressure on the delivery partner.\\\\nThis brings us onto our third point\\\\n3. Internal Structure of the warehouses\\\\nOperational efficiency is the name of the game when it comes to any operations heavy business. And Zepto achieves operational efficiency in a class of its own üßóüèº‚ôÄÔ∏è.\\\\nThe operations have streamlined the entire warehouse with a data led approach. They‚Äôve looked at the items which move the quickest and have placed it closer to the entrance. Groceries which are not frequenlty ordered are de-prioritised and placed at the back.\\\\nThe creative below will give you an idea of how a darkstore might be structured based on the order frequency of different items. Although this structure is just an example and is subject to change based on several other factors.\\\\nBut Multiply this structural formula with item size, refrigeration needs, fragility & you will get a repeatable model of how to design all your warehouses at scale üöÄ\\\\nFor example, fruits & vegetables are one of their most important and highest margin categories. Hence they have decided to place them in shelves closer to the entrance, where they‚Äôre very easy grab and place into delivery bags.\\\\nTo draw parallels, this is very similar to how the founders of McDonalds designed their Kitchen to complete customer orders in less than two minutes ü§Ø\\\\nIf you haven‚Äôt seen ‚ÄòThe Founder‚Äô on Netflix, this is an open call to see it ASAP. If you‚Äôre working in an operations heavy business or interested in building one, please remember that operational efficiency is crucial for your long term success.\\\\nBut, how do you design superfast systems even when human decisions are part of the system?\\\\nA human operator has to look at the order and decide the chronological order of items in the delivery bag. This takes time and there is also the risk of human errors. Items might be missed or fragile items might end up getting placed at the bottom of the bag (No one likes to have their eggs & tomatoes crushed under a watermelon ‚òπÔ∏è)\\\\nSo the team came up with a pretty simple solution - Give a tablet like device to each operations executive in the darkstore. It works like a Google map, guiding the executive to pickup the items placed in the warehouse.\\\\nOnce the operator is assigned an order, they are told where and how to pick each item in a chronological order.\\\\nTheir CTO Kaivalya says ‚ÄúWe wanted to remove human decisions as much as possible. So each of our executives have a handheld software device driving them through the most optimal pathway‚Äù\\\\nThis system works like a charm and has allowed them to exponentially open new dark stores across India üöÄ, while maintaining quality control.\\\\n4. Incredibly short distances to delivery:\\\\nBigBasket took anywhere between 3 hours to a day to deliver a bag of groceries, while Zepto does it in 10 minutes. A lot of this speed is heavily owed to a warehouse that is present in close proximity to an urban location. This is just simple physics bringing down the time of the last mile delivery.\\\\nSince the distances are closer, the delivery executives are also able to fulfill their orders quicker. Moreover with customers who order frequently, Zepto can assign the same set of delivery partners to fullfil their orders. Since they are well acquainted with the location of the customers, this brings the Time To Deliver even lower üëçüèº.\\\\n5. Driver‚Äôs Familiarity with their locality:\\\\nThe operations team at Swiggy use incredibly sophisticated Machine Learning models to bring down the total deliver time. Right from choosing which partner gets which order to how many order each partner picks up.\\\\nThis allows the delivery partner to\\\\nPickup multiple order and deliver them on the way\\\\nDeliver one order and pickup an order from a nearby hotel\\\\nTo even give you a rough estimation, Swiggy has to calculate four things before assigning a delivery partner to your order.\\\\nThis gets more complex when the delivery executive has to pickup one more order or has to deliver one more order on the way to your house.\\\\nIf you thought that was complex, think about assigning a delivery partner at random. Sometimes they might be familiar with your area. Sometimes they might not be familiar with your locality. Now combine this with traffic and other humane errors!\\\\nWith Zepto, some of these problems like Prep Time are naturally removed due to the nature of the business. Since the drivers are also operating in a familiar locality, the first mile & last mile times are brought down significantly.\\\\nHere‚Äôs how the Zepto would calculate time for a delivery partner who‚Äôs already at the darkstore\\\\nThe human factor is definitely one of the bigger advantages of Zepto. In a matter of weeks, the delivery partners become familiar with each road and each shortcut. Familiarity breeds speed and the delivery partners get quick with time.\\\\nIf you‚Äôre interested about how Swiggy does their driver routing, please do give this and this a read üëçüèº\\\\n2. How does Zepto make money üí∏?\\\\nWe‚Äôve seen how Zepto operates from a micro and a macro view. They store groceries in a darkstore and deliver them with the help of their delivery partners. But all this seems like a costly affair to run. They have to pay rent for each darkstore, salaries for darkstore operators & payments for delivery partners. These are fixed operating costs to Zepto.\\\\nAdd this on top of the tech, product & marketing costs, it‚Äôll give you a fair idea of the amount of money required to keep Zepto alive. So how does Zepto earn money selling groceries?\\\\nHere are the five ways they are currently earning money ü§ë, along with one potential way Zepto they can earn money in the future üöÄ\\\\n1. Margins on each individual product:\\\\nThe most common way grocery delivery startups earn money is on the margins of each individual product. This model is similar to the retailers who buy goods at a lower cost from distributors and sell it at a higher price ‚úÖ\\\\nFor example, let‚Äôs assume that Zepto sells a kg of onion for a price of 24 rupees. They earn margins on this by buying a large quantity from a distributor at a lower price.\\\\nWe went to the internet and checked for prices of onions from distributors. The prices range from anywhere between 10 rupees/ kg to 20 rupees/ kg.\\\\nIf they are able to tie up with a buyer at the lowest price, this is definitely a win win for both of them. Because Zepto gets onion at a lower price and the distributor also gets his order fulfilled almost frequently leading to repeatable revenue numbers.\\\\nFor starters we did some calculations as to how much revenue Zepto could earn from just one warehouse and from onion üß†\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume that Zepto orders 100 kg of onion for one of its warehouses in Bandra every day.\\\\nThe price of one kilogram of onion comes around to 10 rupees.\\\\nSo let‚Äôs assume that the total cost to Zepto along with transportation is 1200 rupees.\\\\nLet‚Äôs also assume an ideal state where they are able to sell the entire 100 kg over the same day.\\\\nWe know that zepto currently sells onion at a price of 24 rupees/ kg.\\\\nNow that‚Äôs 2400 rupees before taxes & other charges.\\\\nNot bad for 100 kgs of onion sold in just one darkstore.\\\\nAccording to their CTO, Kaivalya -‚ÄùPotatoes, Onion, Tomatoes are some of our highest selling items on Zepto. Fruits & vegetables also happen to be one of the highest margin items on our platform‚Äù\\\\nOnion is just one category here. One look into Zepto and you‚Äôll see hundreds of vegetables, fruits, and quick perishable items, all of which are high margin items on Zepto!\\\\n2. Handling Charges\\\\nHandling charge is the fee collected by Zepto to organise, pack and dispatch the items on your list. We clicked on the ‚Äòinformation‚Äô button to understand more about this handling charge and we were thrown the following message - ‚ÄúHandling charge is levied to ensure the products are handled, packed & dispatched safely‚Äù\\\\nWe tried to see if a handling charge is levied by all grocery delivery platforms in India\\\\nSwiggy Instamart - Yes, they had a handling charge\\\\nBigBasket NOW - They had something called a delivery token, but it seemed very similar to this handling charge\\\\nBlinkit - Surprisingly, they did not have a handling charge\\\\nWe figured that the handling charge was not a set standard across all grocery delivery platforms. So this is something that is levied by platforms in different ways.\\\\n3. Delivery Charges\\\\nThis is the second bigger piece of solving the profitability equation for most delivery grocery startups. Delivery charge is a big incredibly important for solving profitability because\\\\nNo matter the size of the order, Zepto has to pay the same delivery fee to their delivery partner\\\\nBut high delivery charges can also be a reason why users stop buying from Zepto\\\\nThe key here is to find the balance between waiving delivery charges and growing profitably üí™üèº. Zepto has solved this problem by choosing to charge customers for orders with a low value basket size. However if you break a certain threshold, you‚Äôll unlock the option to get a ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô\\\\nIncreasing the threshold to unlock free delivery does two things\\\\nIncreases the AOV of each order by encouraging customer to order more\\\\nImprove revenue by charging delivery fee on orders with low AOV\\\\nThe net benefit is aimed at increasing overall revenue from the ‚Äòdelivery fee‚Äô lever. But it might also reduce the overall order frequency for certain ICPs who are Power users. High delivery fees might discourage users who use Zepto to order everything at the last minute.\\\\nHence this a profit lever the ‚ÄòGrowth Team‚Äô must constantly tweak and experiment with data!\\\\nBut the fact is that people are tier 1 cities are increasingly favouring CONVENIENCE >>> MONEY. Our hypothesis is that most folks won‚Äôt mind paying a delivery fee of 25 - 50 get their order delivered.\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume that Sheila orders from Zepto 6 times a week\\\\n‚Üí Even if she gets 3 free deliveries a week, we still have 3 deliveries where Zepto earns a revenue\\\\n‚Üí If she‚Äôs paying 35/ delivery, that‚Äôs 105 rupees for a week.\\\\n‚Üí Extrapolate that across a month and Zepto has earned a revenue of 420 rupees.\\\\n‚Üí Assuming there are 100 customers like her in one dark store, Zepto has just earned 42,000 rupees just from deliveries.\\\\nYou should note that these these numbers are highly speculative and can vary a lot. But you get the gist. Done right, Zepto can find a balance between earning from delivery charges while also maintaining the user frequency ü´Ç\\\\nOne interesting fact to note that if your order is less than 50 rupees, Zepto levies a fee of ‚ÄòSmall Cart Fee‚Äô of Rupees 35. This will incentivise the user to add more to their cart quite naturally!\\\\n4. Product Customisations:\\\\nUser Research is something we push actively in the GrowthX experience. Before you hypothesize any solution, you should always seek to understand your users and their problems.\\\\nIn Zepto‚Äôs case, it‚Äôs safe to say that they‚Äôve identified their customers and their problems incredibly well. One good example is under their fruits and vegetables section\\\\nRight from peeled onion, to cut carrots & loose corn. They have identified ways to take existing vegetables, customize them and increase their prices üöÄ\\\\nFor example:\\\\n500 grams of carrot costs 45 rupees.\\\\nBringing it down to 100 grams this costs just 9 rupees.\\\\nBut 200 grams of peeled carrots costs 53 rupees on Zepto.\\\\nBringing this down to 100 grams costs a whopping 26 rupees\\\\nBy simply washing and cutting up the carrots, they have found ways to increase their margins on their products.\\\\nSimple economics shows a 300% increase in price ü§Ø just by customising the product a bit.\\\\nSure you‚Äôll have to buy expensive machinery or employ people to help with these customisation. But if Zepto is able to achieve good volumes, this cost will also go down as it‚Äôs fixed!\\\\nZepto definitely nailed ‚ÄòPeople don‚Äôt buy your product, they buy the solution that can be achieved with your product‚Äô ü§òüèº\\\\n5. Product Ads:\\\\nProduct Ads are a proven way to earn predictable revenue in most e-commerce and marketplace businesses. Zepto also pulls this off Product Ads in a flawless manner\\\\nAlmost everyone in the grocery space uses product ads as a monetary lever.\\\\nThe concept is simple: If you‚Äôre a retailer, you can give money to Zepto to feature your products at the top of certain searches & categories.\\\\nFor example, Bru features their ‚ÄòBru Instant Pure Coffee Jar‚Äô at the first position for the keyword ‚Äòcoffee.\\\\n6. Membership:\\\\nThis is a model Zepto hasn‚Äôt experimented yet, but proves to a very solid model for predictable revenue growth. Swiggy has already rolled out this membership model in the name of ‚ÄòSwiggy One‚Äô.\\\\nBy subscribing to their membership, you can get\\\\nFree deliveries on all orders\\\\nNo surge fees\\\\nBetter discounts\\\\nOther ecommerce startups also have similar models like\\\\nAmazon‚Äôs ‚ÄòAmazon Prime‚Äô,\\\\nFlipkart‚Äôs ‚ÄòFlipkart Plus‚Äô &\\\\nMeesho‚Äôs upcoming membership model.\\\\nThe membership will model will allow Zepto to predict how their revenue will grow with certainty. It can also be beneficial since it increase customer retention and serves as a good moat!\\\\nWe will have to wait and see if Zepto also rolls out this feature in the future!\\\\nüí°\\\\nBy the way, the depth you see here is just a feeler of the depth we teach at GrowthX üí´\\\\nGrowthX is an invite-only club of over 3000 members who are product, marketing, and business leaders, and founders from top internet-first companies like Google, Canva, CRED, Stripe, Netflix, and more üíé\\\\nWe teach our members how to scale revenues via frameworks that can be applied starting next Monday morning.

This growth is possible because they had a structured approach to growth in the first place. Be it creating marketing copies or opening up new darkstores, everything has a structure in place.\\\\nIn this section we will create a structured Growth strategy for Zepto to reach a business goal in a specific period of time.\\\\n1. Who is Zepto‚Äôs Ideal customer?\\\\nBefore we nail down on Zepto‚Äôs ICP, let‚Äôs look at a couple of practical use cases of Zepto\\\\nYou have a few visitors at home and you need to serve them snacks. Maybe you order some fruits and snack items on Zepto for your visitors\\\\nYou are prepping for breakfast when you realise the batter you have has expired. So you go to Zepto and order for some fresh ID dosa batter\\\\nYou are preparing lunch when you realise that you don‚Äôt have any onions left for dinner. Maybe you order some onions along with a fresh set of groceries for the next three days\\\\nYou feel the need to snack and want some biscuits and chips. So you go to Zepto to order some snacks along with essential groceries for the week\\\\nYou step into the washroom to brush your teeth, only to realise you are out of paste. You quickly open Zepto and get some paste delivered in the next 10 minutes\\\\nThese are just a tiny subset of the use cases of Zepto. Also most of these examples were just around groceries. Zepto also has a ton of other sub categories like\\\\nCleaning Essentials\\\\nMakeup items\\\\nBaby care\\\\nBath & Body care\\\\nElectricals & Accessories\\\\n& much more\\\\nA simple probability check will show you that the use cases are in the thousands (and growing as Zepto plans to add new categories ü§òüèº). Before you build any growth strategy, you need to find a way to bucket these millions of users & use cases into something consumable.\\\\nThis look into Zepto‚Äôs ideal customer is nothing perfect. But it will give you a solid foundation into Zepto‚Äôs primary users.\\\\nWe have borrowed these insights from the assignment submitted by one of our members - Aadeesh Deshpande (GX12).

Understanding the market (TAM, SAM, SOM)\\\\nIn an interview with Master‚Äôs Union, their CTO Kaivalya Arora says ‚Äúwe went from 5 to 77+ dark stores from Sep to Dec, 2022‚Äù\\\\nThis massive growth is backed by some of the top investors in the market like Nexus, Glade Brook & YCombinator. This is even after there are tons of grocery startups in the market like Instamart, Blinkit and let‚Äôs not forget Tata‚Äôs BigBasket!\\\\nThis is possible because of the nature & scale of the grocery business in India üáÆüá≥\\\\nTheir CEO points the scale of the grocery & essential industry in a beautiful way - ‚ÄúDmart has built a $40 Billion dollar business in a matter of 20 years. If we can even capture a portion of that volume, we can build a profitable business effectively‚Äù\\\\nSo the question is\\\\n‚ùì\\\\nHow big is the grocery market and how much market share is available for Zepto?\\\\nIndia is a massive country with a total population of 1.5 billion people ü§Ø\\\\nBut Zepto cannot cater to this entire base as most of them are located in Tier 2+ cities & rural areas. Maybe Zepto will tap everyone in India (in the future) or maybe we‚Äôll have a Tier 2+ focused startup like Meesho focusing on just that market!\\\\nBut for the foreseeable future, Zepto will only be focusing on the folks living in Tier1+ cities with Annual salaries greater than 10 lakh/ annum\\\\nKartik Narang (GX10), a fellow GrowthX member and Capabilities & Insights Analyst McKinsey laid out this TAM calculation in an incredible manner in one of his acquisition assignmentsüöÄ\\\\nCondition\\\\nCalculation\\\\nTotal Population in Tier 1 Cities in India\\\\n70 Million\\\\nPercentage of People between 20 & 40 years of age\\\\n40%\\\\nTotal Population in Tier 1 cities between the age of 20 - 40\\\\n28 Million\\\\nPercentage of Annual Income greater than 10 lakhs\\\\n40%\\\\nTotal Population in Tier 1 cities between the age 20 - 40 with Annual Income greater than 10 lakhs\\\\n11.2 Million\\\\nAverage number of people per household\\\\n4\\\\nTotal Number of houses that can be reached\\\\n11.2/ 4 ‚áí 3 Million households\\\\n„Ö§\\\\n„Ö§\\\\nThe total TAM in terms of the number of households can be assumed anywhere between 3 to 7 million based on the variations in the following categories\\\\nSwati Poddar (GX9), another fellow GrowthX member and PM at Walmart has smartly converted this into revenue numbers by multiplying the TAM with the average spend on groceries for each household. This was also an acquisition assignment as part of the GrowthX learning experience.\\\\nüí°\\\\nBy the way, the depth you see here is just a feeler of the depth we teach at GrowthX üí´\\\\nGrowthX is an invite-only club of over 3000 members who are product, marketing, and business leaders, and founders from top internet-first companies like Google, Canva, CRED, Stripe, Netflix, and more üíé\\\\nWe teach our members how to scale revenues via frameworks that can be applied starting next Monday morning.

But this doesn‚Äôt mean that one of their calculations are wrong.\\\\nTAM calculation is all about making informed assumptions with the data we have in mind\\\\nIn Swati‚Äôs case, she considered the average number of people/ household as 2.5.

Zepto‚Äôs Growth Strategy\\\\nBased on this market & ICP research, we can create a Growth Strategy for Zepto. The growth strategy contains five main levers which are\\\\nAcquisition\\\\nOnboarding\\\\nEngagement & Retention\\\\nMonetisation\\\\nBuilding a Growth Team\\\\nBut all of these levers don‚Äôt mean anything when you don‚Äôt understand the core goal.\\\\nWe have built this growth strategy using the same foundations we teach our members as part of the GrowthX Learning Experience. If you also want to create structured and outcome driven growth model like this for your startup, check out our experience here üí™üèº\\\\nWhat is Zepto‚Äôs goal for the next 2 - 5 years?\\\\nIf you ask us, we definitely have no clue. So that‚Äôs why we are going to hypothesize their goals based on two things\\\\nTheir current growth numbers\\\\nFounder Interviews on YouTube\\\\nLooking at both, one things becomes very clear. One of their current goals is to grow as quickly as possible. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that they don‚Äôt have profitability in mind. They are looking to grow their revenue numbers with the goal of achieving optimal profitability in the next two to five years.\\\\nThey also understand that anyone can copy their business model and quickly overtake them. So their core goal is to also open new dark stores across various markets, establish their presence, gain users & use that as their MOAT!\\\\nIn simple words, you could hypothesise their goal as\\\\n‚Üí Expand to all Tier 1 cities in India and achieve a revenue of XXXX in YYYY number of years\\\\nSince we don‚Äôt have any insider information about Zepto, we‚Äôre just going to assume the revenue number as $500 Million ARR and year as 3. We assume this because Their CEO mentions in one the interviews that they had easily crossed $100 Million ARR a while back.\\\\nSince acquiring new users is going to play a key role, we are going to prioritise Acquisition as our first lever\\\\nSince retaining these users and getting them back is also key to revenue growth & profitabilty, we‚Äôre going to prioritise Engagement & Retention as our second lever\\\\nSince it‚Äôs a mobile app, we need to make sure any user who‚Äôs downloading it, actually ends up using Zepto. We‚Äôre focusing on our Onboarding lever as the third priority\\\\nFinally, we cannot let profitability be an afterthought. It also needs a bit of focus fro the get go. So we‚Äôre going with our Monetisation lever as the fourth priority\\\\nOnce we break down all these levers, we‚Äôll get a very clear idea on how to build our Growth team. Some common questions like\\\\nWho To Hire?\\\\nWhen To Hire?\\\\nBudgets For Hiring?\\\\nWhich are must have roles and good to have roles?\\\\nNOTE: Your growth strategy is not set in stone. Based on the business goals, the market conditions and tons of other factors, your growth strategy will always be evolving. The best growth minds are always aware of this and are willing to tweak their strategies based on the macro and micro changes üöÄ.\\\\n4. Acquisition\\\\nWe have defined 4 different ICPs in the ideal customer section. Each ICP has a different set of needs and different marketing strategies that work for them.\\\\nA really good growth team understand this and will tweak their marketing strategies based on the ICP they‚Äôre trying to reach.\\\\nFor this case, we‚Äôre just going to look at ICP 1 - The ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô. These are folks in the age range of 20 - 25 and purchase everything from online grocery platforms like Instamart, Zepto & BigBasket.\\\\nWe will only create a Growth Model for this ICP. Since they have a lot of unplanned purchases, their usage frequency is also very high. Also because they are young and have a lot of disposable income, their ability & willingness to spend is also high.\\\\nThe most common acquisition channels to reach our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô are\\\\nYou can use the quick links below to jump to any specific section in our Acquisition Lever\\\\nNow let‚Äôs break down all the acquisition levers for Zepto‚Äôs growth model\\\\nOrganic\\\\nZepto‚Äôs organic strategy for the ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô has three splits. This is based on how they discover new products and where they usually spend their time on.\\\\nSearch Engine Optimisation (SEO):\\\\nSEO is the art of ranking your business when your ideal customer searches for it. Since SEO is a pull channel, you need to identify the different ways in which your customers might search for your product\\\\nHere are some common themes we were able to identify with Search Engine Optimisation.\\\\nHere‚Äôs the breakdown with some common examples\\\\nMost of the keywords here were occupied by market leaders like Amazon & BigBasket. Currently Zepto doesn‚Äôt seem to have an SEO strategy in place. It‚Äôs website is also pretty basic, displaying just information information only about their organisation.\\\\nFor starters, their main competitor BigBasket brings around 6.4 million website visitors from smartphone traffic alone. It‚Äôs the ideal time for Zepto to think about organic SEO strategies if they‚Äôre certain about building this for the long term üöÄ\\\\nTo start with SEO, they need to invest in a website strategy that ties in with their app usage. Most of their users will use Zepto on their app. But the website is primarily to build pages and capture the SEO traffic.\\\\nEventually Zepto will also have to build a full scale website like BigBasket if they want to tap into the fullscale SEO potential.\\\\nApp Store Optimisation(ASO):\\\\nSince Zepto is a mobile app first business, App Store & Play Store discovery is a high priority. App Store Optimisation is the art of ranking your app for relevant searches and in the relevant categories.\\\\nASO can also be broken down into the three types of searches, which we have broken down in the Whimsical below\\\\nApart from search, you also need to ensure your app is free from technical glitches and bugs. Pair this with a healthy number of positive reviews, your app will also be displayed in top positions under\\\\nRelated Applications\\\\nTop Free Apps\\\\nTrending Apps\\\\netc..\\\\nYour best bet is to make sure your app\\\\nIs free from technical glitches\\\\nHas an incredible user experience\\\\nTons of Positive Reviews (Possibly 4+ stars)\\\\nSocial Media:\\\\nSocial Media is yet another untapped opportunity for Zepto. One of the reasons we suggest social media is because\\\\nSwiggy, Zomato and a lot of D2C, FMCg brands have been doubling down on Organic social for the same reasons. While it requires constant effort and a lot of experimentation to stay relevant on social, the efforts gradually pay off.\\\\nSince the ‚ÄòYoung Gun‚Äô ICPs are extremely young and spend a lot of time on social media applications, it makes perfect sense ü§òüèº\\\\nThe Social Media strategy would be a mix of long form content (For YouTube etc) and Short form content (for YouTube Shorts & Reels)\\\\nLong Form Content ‚Üí\\\\nThe general theme of long form content is to provide value first. We can start with things ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô might already be searching for. Since some of them might be living alone, some ideas could be\\\\nCooking Tips\\\\nHome Cleaning Tips\\\\nHealthy Eating Tips\\\\netc‚Ä¶.\\\\nShort Form Content ‚Üí\\\\nShort form content should focus on funny anecdotes and things these folks might find relatable.\\\\nFunny Reels\\\\nRelatable Memes\\\\nQuick Informational Videos\\\\netc‚Ä¶.\\\\nHowever considering the entire macro, social media needs to be inclusive of all ICPs. It should not just be relatable to our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô. The overall brand persona and positioning should also be in mind when creating these strategies.\\\\nZepto has had a very heavy reliance on PAID Ads to grow. It is fair given how their business is location dependant and Paid is the best channel for location based targeting.\\\\nSince PAID Ads can be customised and deployed quite quickly, it‚Äôs Time To Value from them is much quicker. Paid Ads can be divided into three sub categories\\\\nThese are advertisements that will be displayed on search engines like Google, Bing and other platforms. The targeting here is based on individual keywords, rather than just interests or demographic data üöÄ\\\\nProduct Ads:\\\\nProduct based ads which focus on specific products can be extremely useful for Zepto. They have two strategies for product base search ads\\\\nProducts that are low AOV, but high margins (fruits, vegetables etc..)\\\\nProducts that are high AOV, but low margin (Oil, Atta etc..)\\\\nProducts that have a high purchase frequency, but low AOV & ROI (Snacks, Quick Munchies)\\\\nWhich products they want to go after is entirely dependant on a strategy backed by data üíΩ\\\\nBrand Ads:\\\\nBrand Ads can be used for keywords where someone is searching for your product, but you don‚Äôt have the sub pages ready for it.\\\\nOr you can also use it to capitalise on the Inbound search terms until SEO kicks in.\\\\nBrand Ads can also be used to kick out competitors for products which Zepto thinks will give them good retention.\\\\nCompetitor Ads:\\\\nThese ads can be run over competitor pages or also be run over products which Zepto‚Äôs competitor‚Äôs are ranking for. Yet again, this can be used to capture a new market, a new product if you think they might help with your retention rates.\\\\nSocial Ads:\\\\nSocial ads come in really handy when you‚Äôre trying to target based on location, interests or both.\\\\nIf Zepto is trying to scale up each individual dark store chronologically, this is a great way to reach customers. You can target based on age, interests, gender & more based on the data platforms given by advertising platforms ü§òüèº\\\\nWe need to be mindful of two things when running social ads\\\\nWhat‚Äôs the key value proposition for this ICP?\\\\nHow do we convert that into our messaging?\\\\nWhich social platforms are they most active in?\\\\nAs we‚Äôre just focusing on the ‚ÄòYoung Gun‚Äô ICP, we also need to make sure the messaging is on point for them. Their messaging can be derived from their Key Value Propositions such as\\\\n10 Min Delivery\\\\nFresh Groceries At Your Doorstep\\\\nSave Time\\\\nHere‚Äôs how a static ad might look for them on a social media platform\\\\nHere‚Äôs an example of a dynamic ad for Zepto.\\\\nIt‚Äôs both quirky and conveys the Key Value Proposition under 15 seconds. Perfect for social media platforms\\\\nWhile running social ads, we also need to mindful of the platforms each ICP is active on. Our ICP is active on Instagram, Snapchat & Facebook which are all good platforms to start with üé¢\\\\nApp Store Ads:\\\\nSince they‚Äôre an app first platform, it makes a lot of sense to prioritise App Store Ads when you‚Äôre starting with the paid channel. The grocery market is a bit mature thanks to old players like BgBasket, Blinkit and other incumbents\\\\nSo it‚Äôs Zepto‚Äôs best bet to capitalise on the existing search volume on these platforms üöÄ\\\\nApp Store Ads can also be of two types as shown below\\\\nThese ad formats are a different beast in themselves. For the sake of keeping this short we are skipping the technicalities in this section for now.\\\\nThere‚Äôs an universal truth we need to understand before we get into Product Integrations. No app, product or business exists out there in Unison. While your customer is using your product, they are also simultaneously using multiple other products at the same time.\\\\nProduct Integration is the concept of seeking a natural fit with the products used by your users and integrating with them.\\\\nBut some ground rules before we seek Product Integrations\\\\nThe Product should not be a direct competitor to Zepto\\\\nThe Product Integration pitch should feel natural and personalised\\\\nThe product should also have good trust (as trust can be destroyed by partnering with a wrong brand)\\\\nThe product should preferably have the same or higher usage frequency than Zepto\\\\nFrom user interviews conducted by GrowthX members, we have discovered that Zepto users also use some products like UrbanClap, Netflix, Hotstar, EatFit etc‚Ä¶\\\\nHere are some interesting product integrations we can work out with the following products\\\\nUrban Company\\\\nHotstar\\\\nEatFit\\\\nThese are just some examples from the top of our head. Once you do more intense customer research, you will be able to find better products that have a better fit with your offerings.\\\\nPartnerships are lesser known ways to get your brand in front of tons of new customers. Zepto can approach partnerships in two different ways\\\\nInfluencer Partnerships\\\\nProduct Placements\\\\nEach has their merit and difference in their payback periods!\\\\nInfluencer Led Partnerships\\\\nThis essentially focuses on partnering with influencers whom your audience are also hooked into. Most of these partnerships are based on behavioural insights which can be derived from customer calls, surveys etc.\\\\nSince we‚Äôre trying to reach the ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô, we will start with the platforms they‚Äôre most active on - IG & YouTube. Step 2 is understanding the themes or which channels/ pages they follow.\\\\nWe know that this persona is focused on improving their career. So a good place to start is with channels that focus on ‚ÄòCareer specific advice‚Äô. Some of them could also be interested in cooking channels üï∫üèº.\\\\nThe main idea is to identify a theme and then double on those specific channels with a solid pitch.\\\\nProduct Placements\\\\nWeb series & movies are a great way to place your products in a subtle manner. The actor sipping on a cold coffee he ordered from Zepto. Or maybe the family member ordering something on Zepto.\\\\nThese are all subtle pitches to place your products in mainstream movies as well as smaller films & web series.\\\\nUnacademy pulled this off incredibly well with their product placements in tv series like Kota Factory, Operation MBBS etc. Product Placements should feel like natural and in sync with the plot. The core idea is to solidify Zepto as a product everyone uses casually in their life.\\\\nOffline ads probably have one of the best product-channel fits for Zepto because of their hyperlocal nature. When done right, this channel can solve for discovery for a very specific set of ICPs in one location. The best ICP to start with is our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô\\\\nHere are a couple of offline channel ideas to target ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô in their daily life\\\\nThey mostly take an Ola or Uber to reach their workplace\\\\nWe can place ads in autos & cabs behind the driver‚Äôs seat\\\\nThey might take a bus or the use the metro train\\\\nWe can also place banners in specially designated boards at these stops\\\\nThey will use the lift atleast twice a day in their office space\\\\nWe can place an ad inside the lift walls\\\\nThey will walk past the lobby in their office space (preferably an IT park)\\\\nWe can place custom booths that encourage people to download and try Zepto\\\\nOffline channels come in a variety of ways and help us target folks in a very specific locality!\\\\nFor most consumer led applications, referrals can be an incredible acquisition tool. Since our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô are highly social and tech savvy, referral can have a good product market fit for them.\\\\nAll good referral programs will nail 4 things in depth\\\\nThe reward for both the referrer and the referee\\\\nWhy will someone refer?\\\\nWhen will someone refer?\\\\nHow easy it is to refer?\\\\nEach section can use a separate page in reality. But for this guide, we‚Äôre going to focus on Zepto and our target ICP - ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô.\\\\nWhy will someone refer Zepto?\\\\nAt the heart of every successful referral program lies an incredible customer experience. The best reason someone will refer Zepto is when they have a great experience with it. A great experience is delivered when\\\\nThey get their order in under 15 minutes\\\\nThe items are fresh and undamaged\\\\nThe packaging is good\\\\nThey get exactly what they ordered for (not something different - happens frequently in grocery delivery apps)\\\\nTheir AOV of each order is high (Depth)\\\\nThey keep ordering multiple times a week (frequency)\\\\nThe idea here is to identify when someone has a good experience and then take them to the referral loop\\\\nWhen will someone refer Zepto?\\\\nThe discovery of the referral loop should always be placed in the ‚ÄòHappy Flow‚Äô of the customer.\\\\nSome examples of happy flows are\\\\nAfter a customer receives their order in under 15 minutes\\\\nAfter a customer has submitted a review\\\\nThe goal is to identify screens where the user is in a ‚ÄòHappy Flow‚Äô yet it still won‚Äôt hinder the primary goal (complete an order)\\\\nWhat is the reward?\\\\nA good reward does two things\\\\nEnables the customer to keep referring\\\\nEnables the new customers to & old customers to keep using the app\\\\nIn that frame of mind, rewards should be app specific and increase the usage of the app. Monetary rewards are good, but they prevent the users from investing the reward back into the app.\\\\nApp specific coins, coupons and dicsounts are always good currencies for a referral system. One such reward is Zepto‚Äôs ‚ÄòZepto cash‚Äô. It provides both the referrer and the referee with credits they can only use in Zepto.\\\\nHow easy is it to refer?\\\\nEase of a referral system depends on two things\\\\nDiscovery of the referral system\\\\nAbility to Track your referrals\\\\nDiscovery can be solved by showing the referral link in all the ‚ÄòHappy Flows‚Äô and also on the sidebar.\\\\nAbility to track referrals is important because it allows the referrer to understand where his referees are\\\\nHave they clicked on the link\\\\nHave the downloaded the app\\\\nHave they made their first transaction\\\\nBut building a referral program like this is resource intensive and takes up a lot of development effort (even with the use of tools!)\\\\nA good idea is to run a test to a small population before deploying it to tons of users. Some things that can be tested are\\\\nRewards for referee\\\\nRewards for referrer\\\\nPlacement of the referral link\\\\nTracking of the referral link\\\\nDifferent ways to share the referral link\\\\nHere are some metrics Zepto can track to ensure the success of it‚Äôs referral program\\\\nNumber of active users sending invites\\\\nNumber of invites per referrer\\\\nConversion rate to link clicks\\\\nConversion rate to app downloads\\\\nConversion rate to first purchase\\\\nConversion rate to first review\\\\nSo that‚Äôs all about the acquisiton strategies for Zepto ü§òüèº. Now let‚Äôs take a look into the next most important lever for Zepto‚Äôs success - E&R.\\\\nEngagement & Retention are the holy grail of building a successful product in any market. We could even go further and say, Engagement & Retention are the pillars of any successful business.\\\\nGood engagement leads to better retention.\\\\nBetter retention leads to revenue and word of mouth.\\\\nGood revenue means you can invest in the best talent, improve the product even more and rule the market\\\\nWord of mouth means that you can now acquire customers at costs that keep getting lower\\\\nAll these combine into a vicious cycle which make any product/ business successful.\\\\nWhere does retention come here?\\\\nSome of the best product teams think about retention right from the Onboarding. It‚Äôs all about helping the user become powerful with the product. Retention is never an afterthought in any successful product. When done right, retention can drive product & even business decisions.\\\\nHow does Engagement & Retention apply to our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nBefore we even dive into the engagement framework for our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô, we need to understand some basic terms üëáüèº\\\\nFrequency of usage - Number of times someones orders from Zepto\\\\nDepth - No of items ordered in each category (Tomato, Onion, Potato under the vegetables section)\\\\nBreadth - No of categories ordered (1 Vegetable, 2 fruits, 1 Bread, 1 oil etc..)\\\\nThese are the 3 pillars of good engagement.\\\\nBased on these pillars we can define users into 3 buckets üëáüèº\\\\nCasual - People who order from Zepto once a week - once every two weeks\\\\nCore - People who order from Zepto two to three times a week\\\\nPower - People who order from Zepto 4+ times a week\\\\nWe are yet again going to pull excerpts from Aadeesh Deshpande‚Äôs (GX12) assignment on Zepto to deep dive into our framework.\\\\nThere are three types of buying habits for Zepto‚Äôs users üëáüèº\\\\nStock Up - Plan & buy groceries for the entire week\\\\nTop Up - Buying items that generally have a low shelf life (Vegetables, fruits, bread, milk etc.)\\\\nUnplanned Purchases - Items that might have run out without knowledge or items that have a sudden need (Oil, masala powders, Alcohol, Snacks etc..)\\\\nHere are some facts we know about our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô from the table we‚Äôve added above\\\\nCharacteristics\\\\nPotential ICP 1\\\\nName\\\\nYoung Guns\\\\nAge\\\\n21 - 26\\\\nIncome\\\\n8 lakhs/ annum+\\\\nRelationship Status\\\\n‚Üí Unmarried\\\\n‚Üí Sometimes in a relationship\\\\nEmployment Status/ Work Experience\\\\n‚Üí Freshly Employed\\\\nCity\\\\nTier 1\\\\nTech Savvy\\\\nYES\\\\nFrequently Used Social Media Apps\\\\nLinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram\\\\nEntertainment Services Used\\\\nDisney+ Hostar, Zee5, Amazon Prime\\\\nEcommerce services used\\\\nBookMyShow, Amazon, Myntra, Nykaa, Swiggy, Zomato, Zepto, Urban Company\\\\nIncome Spent On\\\\n1.

Late Night\\\\nCustomer AOV\\\\nVery High\\\\nAbility To Spend\\\\nVery High\\\\nShift Needed to Spend on Zepto\\\\nNo Shift Needed\\\\nWe know that they rarely stock up on their daily needs. Most of their purchases are last minute and unplanned. We also know that this segment has a ton of disposable income and has a very low barrier of entry to Zepto.\\\\nWe also know that the majority of this segment live in a Tier 1 city which is where Zepto primarily operates. In his research, Aadeesh has quoted a research paper from Redseer which indicates that 70% of all grocery purchases are a mix of unplanned & top-up puchases.\\\\nSo what‚Äôs the engagement campaign for ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nTitle\\\\nContent\\\\nUnderstanding\\\\nWe know that a ton of Young Guns order from Zepto 2 - 3 times a week. But this is only fruits, vegetables & some quick perishables.\\\\nType of user\\\\nAt the moment they are core users\\\\nGoal of the campaign\\\\nGet them to order from other categories like Snacks, Juices, Cleaning Essentials, Electricals etc‚Ä¶\\\\nWe want to eventually increase the breadth of the user and convert them into a power users\\\\nExperiments To Run\\\\n1. Quick Suggestions on the Checkout Screen\\\\n2. Placing other categories at the top of the Home Screen\\\\n3. Special Discounts for Items ordered from a New Category\\\\n4. Suggesting Item Combos based on the items you‚Äôve added in the Cart\\\\nAadeesh Deshpande had an incredible example to convert ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô from Core to Power users.\\\\nHere‚Äôs an example of how this will play out\\\\nItem\\\\nContent\\\\nScenario 1\\\\nA user adds onions & tomatoes\\\\nSample Pitch\\\\nSambhar on your mind?\\\\nItems Suggested\\\\n1.

But all this experimentation needs to be tracked to understand if it‚Äôs a success or not.\\\\nItem\\\\nContent\\\\nMetrics To Track\\\\n1. No of new categories ordered\\\\n2. Cart Size\\\\n3.

Garam Masala\\\\n2. Curd\\\\n3. Ready to eat Chapatti\\\\n4. Cashew nuts\\\\n5. Desserts (if it‚Äôs dinner)\\\\nWhat does Retention look like for ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nFor Zepto, the best retention happens with both depth (more items in one category) and breadth (ordering from multiple categories). Once they start ordering different items, Zepto becomes the go to place for our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô.\\\\nIncreasing Depth and Breadth makes Zepto their Go-To product which naturally increases their frequency of usage.\\\\nWhich channels drive the best retention for ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nTimely Push Notifications:\\\\nPush Notifications that are backed up data is a great option. Let‚Äôs say one person orders a packet of milk every two days at exactly 9 PM. If they haven‚Äôt ordered milk for the last two days, a push notification asking them to order milk can go out ‚úåüèº\\\\nWhatsApp Notifications:\\\\nWhatsApp notifications can also be triggered as reminders for them.\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume that their favourite milkshake brand was out of stock in their last order. We can run a WhatsApp notification to tell them it‚Äôs back in stock\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume the milk example. We can push a WhatsApp notification to remind them\\\\nSlack or Teams Notifications\\\\nThis is a bit contradictory. But we know that ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô are heavily career focused. So there‚Äôs a very high chance that they may be using an internal communication tool like Slack or Microsoft Teams.\\\\nA quick growth test can be to connect their Slack IDs and send them reminders through them. Although be wary as this is just an hypothesis and hasn‚Äôt been proven by any grocery delivery startup yet!\\\\nWhich Products/ Categories drive the best retention?\\\\nQuick Perishable Items like Milk, Eggs, Bread, Fruits & Vegetables (High freq & high margin)\\\\nFlour, Oil, Rice items\\\\nBathroom & home cleaning equipments\\\\nBath, Body & Hygiene products\\\\nIndulgence items like Biscuits, Chips, Cold drinks, Ice cream etc..\\\\nFinally, why would ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô churn?\\\\nChurn can be divided into two types at the very basic level - Voluntary & Involuntary. Once you understand the reasons someone might churn, your team can work on preventing them. An acute understanding of the reasons can also help you fix issues in your marketing & brand perception\\\\nVoluntary Reasons For Churn\\\\nDelivery Time is too long\\\\nWrong Items were delivered\\\\nItems were delivered to the wrong address\\\\nProducts were damaged during delivery\\\\nExpired products were delivered\\\\nHigh delivery fee\\\\nProducts were out of stock\\\\nInvoluntary Reasons For Churn\\\\nShifted to a new location where Zepto is not available\\\\nOut of town for sometime\\\\nIssue with certain payment portals\\\\nAs you start mapping out all the potential reasons someone might churn, you can trace it back to early signs of churn. For example, if delivery time for a certain user has increased and you see a drop in their frequency, there might be some level of causation at play.\\\\nNegative actions to keep an eye on\\\\nDrop in App Open Rate\\\\nA lot of customer support tickets\\\\nDrop in the frequency of orders\\\\nDrop in basket value\\\\nDrop in weekly/ monthly AOV\\\\nIncrease in Cart Abandonment\\\\nA key concept you should keep in mind. There is a very good difference between causation and correlation.\\\\nIf order frequency is going down while delivery time increases, there is a high chance of relation between the two. But there is also a good chance that there‚Äôs no relation between the two.\\\\nMaybe they had a roommate who just moved out. Hence their order frequency is low\\\\nMaybe they started buying their fruits and vegetables from a street vendor because that was easy\\\\nAs a growth person, before you jump into any conclusions, you need to do the due diligence to understand the reason. You can do this by\\\\nSending a survey,\\\\nLooking at their support tickets\\\\nLooking at the change in items orders before & after change of freq\\\\nScheduling a 1:1 calls with your users\\\\n& more..\\\\nAs a growth person, your goal should be to seek the truth before you confirm your hypotheses.\\\\nWhat are some retention campaigns we can run for our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nThis is an example we‚Äôve pulled out from Aadeesh Deshpande‚Äôs assignment on Zepto. We‚Äôre just tweaking a bunch of the ideas for better presentation.\\\\nConcept\\\\nCampaign Details\\\\nTarget Segment\\\\nCore & Power Users\\\\nTarget ICP\\\\nYoung Guns\\\\nPurchase Behaviour For Core Users\\\\n‚Üí Top Ups and last minute unplanned purchases\\\\n‚Üí Mostly fruits, vegetables, groceries & household items\\\\n‚Üí 5+ products in cart\\\\n‚Üí 3 times a week minimum\\\\nPurchase Behaviour For Power Users\\\\n‚Üí All Categories\\\\n‚Üí 2 to 10 products in cart\\\\n‚Üí 5+ times a week minimum\\\\nGoal\\\\nResurrect Core & Power Users\\\\nCampaign Targeting\\\\nFrequency of orders has reduced.\\\\nReason: Increase in Delivery Time\\\\nProposed Solution\\\\nApologise for the delayed delivery time and compensate with Zepto coins!\\\\nPitch/ Content\\\\nPush Notification on app/ WhatsApp Notification\\\\nWe understand that your time is money.\\\\n3 out of your last 5 deliveries were delayed by more than 15 minutes. Please do accept our apologies in the form on 150 Zepto coins!\\\\nFrequency & Timing of Campaign\\\\nThe notification should be sent one week after the last order. A reminder needs to be sent 15 days after if the user is still not resurrected!\\\\nSuccess Metrics\\\\n‚Üí % of users displaying old purchase frequency after 8 weeks\\\\n‚Üí WOW Retention curve\\\\nOther Micro Metrics To Track\\\\n‚Üí App Notification to Click Ratio\\\\n‚Üí Click to ‚ÄòAdd to cart‚Äô ratio\\\\nReasons this campaign will work\\\\n‚Üí By accepting the honest mistake and offering a reward, the core & power users will be happy to come back\\\\n‚Üí The Zepto coins will further incentivise them to give another chance to Zepto!\\\\nAssociated Risks\\\\n‚Üí If the order is delayed again, user may lose trust in the brand & may never come back again\\\\n‚Üí They may be further offended that we are trying to bring them back with cash incentives\\\\nYou can use the same framework to create multiple resurrection campaigns for all types of users. This level of depth will help you prioritise segments in a massive product like Zepto.\\\\nThe same framework can be used for all other voluntary and involuntary churn. As a growth person, your first priority is to understand the reasons and prioritise the solutions on the cohorts which will have the maximum impact.\\\\n6. Onboarding\\\\nSince we‚Äôve prioritised acquisition and engagement & Retention, we‚Äôre not going to focus on the other two levers on this guide. The superpower every growth person must have is the ability to say ‚ÄòNO‚Äô and prioritise with laser focus.\\\\nEven if you have infinite resources to handle, you need to have focus. Focus will help you solve the most important problems effectively. Moreover focus will help you reach your revenue goals effectively!\\\\nBut if you were to work on the Onboarding lever, here are some metrics you could track\\\\nDownload Metrics\\\\nAdd to basket metrics\\\\nCheckout metrics\\\\n‚Üí Channel wise download metrics:\\\\nAds to Downloads\\\\nFacebook ads to app download\\\\nIG Ads to app download\\\\nOrganic to download\\\\nGoogle search to download\\\\nGoogle play store search to download\\\\nApp store search to download\\\\n‚Üí Add to basket metrics:\\\\nNumber of download to registration\\\\nNumber of registrations to ‚ÄòVisited Homepage‚Äô\\\\nNumber of ‚ÄòVisited Homepage‚Äô to ‚ÄòAdd Items to cart‚Äô\\\\nNumber of ‚ÄòAdd Items to cart‚Äô to ‚ÄòVisited Checkout Page‚Äô\\\\n‚Üí Checkout Metrics:\\\\nNumber of items added to cart\\\\nNumber of categories added to cart\\\\nAverage order value\\\\nNumber of users checked out out with COD\\\\nNumber of users checked out with Credit Cards\\\\nNumber of users checked out with UPI\\\\n‚Üí All these metrics can also be further divided into\\\\nDevice\\\\nPlatform\\\\nAcquisition channel\\\\nDark Store\\\\nGeographical Location\\\\nTime\\\\netc‚Ä¶\\\\nThis is a very broad list of metrics you can track to understand your users. As always the metrics you choose will be dependant on your current revenue goals and business priorities.\\\\n7. Monetisation\\\\nFinally, the most important, yet looked upon growth lever is the monetisation lever. Revenue should never be an afterthought for any business. Since this lever is also not a priority at the moment, we are not going to deep dive into it.\\\\nEven before you work on your monetisation lever, you have to run the ‚ÄòLitmus Test‚Äô to understand your retention. Monetisation only works if atleast a certain subset of your users retain after a certain period of time.\\\\nOnce the litmus test is cleared, the monetisation lever has four categories\\\\nWho to charge?\\\\nWhen to charge?\\\\nWhat to charge?\\\\nHow much to charge?\\\\nand that‚Äôs all about the Growth levers for Zepto.\\\\nüí°\\\\nBy the way, the depth you see here is just a feeler of the depth we teach at GrowthX üí´\\\\nGrowthX is an invite-only club of over 3000 members who are product, marketing, and business leaders, and founders from top internet-first companies like Google, Canva, CRED, Stripe, Netflix, and more üíé\\\\nWe teach our members how to scale revenues via frameworks that can be applied starting next Monday morning.

Why is Zepto well positioned to win?\\\\nZepto has grown at breakneck speeds and we truly believe that can win in the long term. Here are some reasons why\\\\n1. Huge market that‚Äôs growing exponentially:\\\\nThe Indian economy is growing at an exponential pace. What happened in the west 20 years back is happening in India currently. As more capital is being poured into the country, new businesses are being formed every day. This leads to a surplus of capital in the economy.\\\\nCapital that can be used to deploy to make you life easier, like buy groceries from Zepto, instead of going to a shop nearby.\\\\nThe picture below shows an estimate of how the Indian economy will grow in the next 25 years.\\\\nThis is the macro shift that BigBasket definitely missed in its formative years.\\\\n2. Customer trust with internet products is growing exponentially:\\\\nThe Indian consumer segment are slowly starting to understand and trust internet products. Before Ola, Flipkart, Myntra and other startups came into play, spending money on the internet was a challenge. And it was not because of the lack of money\\\\nPeople still had disposable income, but the trust levels were quite low. No one were accustomed to spending money on these consumer apps.\\\\nThe advent of internet apps, paired with JIO and UPI changed this game.\\\\nSpending money on the internet became an everyday thing and this naturally improved the trust levels of consumers. Zepto is well positioned at a time where consumer trust on these internet startups is growing exponentially.\\\\n3. Backed by an experienced leadership team:\\\\nThere‚Äôs a reason why Zepto went from zero to 2000+ employees in a matter of two years. Right from the get go, the founders were keen on hiring experienced leader for their management team.\\\\nThey hired folks who had already done that startup journey in the same or a related field. Some of their most senior hires were\\\\nTheir CFO, Jitendra N was already a VP of Finance at Pharmeasy\\\\nTheir CBO, Viral Jhaveri had worked leadership roles in Uber Eats and FreighTigers\\\\nTheir People function is headed by Roma Bindroo handled the people function at Johnson & Johnson for multiple years\\\\nThe founders understood that Zepto is still an operations heavy business with some software at the front. Even if they make the software 100x better, the operations cannot be avoided.\\\\nThey understood the game and started hiring folks who understood operations heavy businesses in the first place. This allowed them to reduce mistakes and scale faster than ever!\\\\nüöÄ\\\\nIf you‚Äôre a leader or a founder, keen to hire the Top 1% Growth Talent in India, do register to our waiting list here. We have helped 100+ top startups like CRED, PayTm, Swiggy & Dunzo hire their Growth talent.\\\\nPlease do fill out the form and one of our Talent Team superstars will reach back to you üí™üèº\\\\n4. Changing customer behaviour:\\\\nWith the boom of the economy, customer behaviour is also changing constantly. More customers are now starting to value Convenience >> Money.\\\\nStartups like Swiggy, Uber, Urban Company are a true testament to this!\\\\n5. High driver retention rate:\\\\nZepto has a 7% higher delivery driver retention rate than all hyperlocal delivery startups in India. This is because of a couple of reasons\\\\nZero long distance deliveries - Drivers hate nothing more than long distance deliveries\\\\nA centralised hub for all drivers - Since Zepto operates only out of dark stores, this gives them a chance to provide a designated waiting area for delivery partners. The founder mentioned that they also provide their partners with water, snacks & otehr condiments to make their life easier.\\\\nWhile 7% maybe a marginal amount, it can eventually add up. Driver experience is a key piece in winning this hyperlocal war. Since there is no penalty or drivers when they jump ships, the player who retains the most, eventually wins in the long term.\\\\n6. High NPS:\\\\nZepto was founded on the core insight of high NPS from the days of Kiranakart (their old startup). Basically customers who received their orders in less than 15 minutes had a higher NPS compared to customers who got it later.\\\\nSince Zepto is built on this core insight, their NPS is close to 80% (which is spectacular)\\\\n7. High Customer Retention rate:\\\\nYet again, during the days of Kiranakart, the founders realised that customers who recieved orders in less than 15 minutes retained better. The 15 min delivery is a WOW factor, around which Zepto is entirely built out of.\\\\nThis helps them own a retention rate of 60% even with 2 million+ customers & growing!\\\\n8. Wave 2 startups FTW:\\\\nWave 1 startups are the BigBaskets and Flipkarts of India. They faced a lot of challenges in terms of the MACRO\\\\nTalent\\\\nEconomical Growth\\\\nConsumer Trust\\\\nPayments\\\\nConsumer Sentiment etc\\\\nIn the last 10 years however, the entire Macro of India has shifted in favour of startups üëáüèº\\\\nThe talent pool has become denser (lots of people who have been there and done that)\\\\nThe economy has grown and is growing by leaps and bounds\\\\nThe people have more trust on Internet startups\\\\nPaying for something has become incredibly easier (thanks to UPI and all the Fintech startups)\\\\nConsumer have started spending more money rather than just saving it\\\\n9. They have solved for delivery accuracy:\\\\nA big challenge with old age grocery delivery startups is order accuracy. Issues like missing some items or even delivering the wrong items is terrible customer experience. The customer on the other end orders grocieries for convenience. Missed or wrong deliveries is probably the most inconvenient thing for them.\\\\nThe founding team developed Zepto with a razer focus of delivering the right order on time. The pay close attention to the dispatch process and fill any leaks to prevent wrong deliveries.\\\\nOther incumbents like Swiggy Instamart, BigBasket have also fixed this in the recent days. Should be interesting to see how they fare against Zepto in the future.\\\\n10. Expanding to new locations:\\\\nZepto‚Äôs founder mentioned in an interview is doubling in business every three months. This is possible because of their rapid expansion to new locations with a ton of darkstores. Since their inception, Zepto has grown from one store in Mumbai to 75+ locations across Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata and other tier 1 metro cities.\\\\nThis has been possible because of an experienced management team and high focus on creating formalised processes for everything!\\\\n11. Expanding to different categories:\\\\nZepto started with just groceries, but now they‚Äôve expanded to beauty accessories, baby products and even electronics. As they slowly figure out the supply chain and formulate the entire process, they can add more categories to this. An example could be umbrellas & raincoats during monsoon.\\\\nThe sky is the limit when they have the supply chain figured out for everything.\\\\n12. Execution On Point:\\\\nGrocery delivery is not a huge innovation. BigBasket and many other incumbents have already done it and grown massively. Even the 15 min delivery can be figured out by other players in a matter of time.\\\\nThe biggest strength of team Zepto is their ability to execute. Momentum is a very sneaky element that exponentially increases your success.\\\\nWhile other players are changing their business model to fit the 10 min delivery, Zepto is already acing it. The first mover advantage alone will carry them far above the finish line. By providing an incredible service, they can retain to all their customers while other incumbents are still building for the market.\\\\n5. What are the reasons Zepto might also lose in the hyper competitive grocery space?\\\\nThere are always two sides to any coin. If there are a couple of reasons why Zepto will win, there are even more reasons as to why it might lose. We wouldn‚Äôt do justice to this guide without looking at those points too!\\\\n1. Expanding to Tier 2 cities will be a challenge:\\\\nTier 1 cities currently contribute to almost the entire revenue of Zepto. Last time we checked, there were no Zepto owned darkstores in tier 2+ cities. Zepto will reach a plateau as they expand across all tier 1 cities.\\\\nThey can only unlock even more growth when they reach tier 2 cities. However tier 2+ cities are built different in terms of\\\\nPopulation distribution\\\\nMindset\\\\nCustomer sentiment\\\\nBuilding Zepto for tier 2+ cities will require a whole different mindset that the current model. They will have to rethink everything which will require time & a lot of money.\\\\n2. Not all dark stores will be profitable:\\\\nThe cold truth is that not all darkstores will be profitable. Power laws can be crazy in business and a small percentage of the dark stores may end up generating the most amount of revenue.\\\\nThe hard part about this is each darkstore, irrespective of revenue will have a fixed operating cost. This will be split between\\\\nSalaries\\\\nRent\\\\nOther bills\\\\nSo at some point Zepto will have to decide between closing low revenue locations or keeping them alive for just overall brand visibility.\\\\n3. White-labelling products is an operational challenge:\\\\nThere is only so much you can earn from selling other brands. That‚Äôs exactly why so many supermarkets end up creating their own products like rice, oil, bread etc..\\\\nIt allows them to control the supply chain and take a bigger share of the revenue pie.\\\\nHowever producing your own products is also investment heavy. While production is the first challenge, Quality Control & Branding is an even bigger challenge. Acquisitions can come in handy for this play.\\\\nWe‚Äôll just have to wait and see how Zepto play this card out!\\\\n4. Free Delivery might hit on the margins:\\\\nWhile ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô is great for the growth stage, it is not sustainable for overall sustenance. At some point, Zepto will have to cut down on ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô. Or they might also need to increase the minimum threshold for ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô.\\\\nThis might lead to a drop in order frequency and users jumping to competitor products who do offer ‚Äò Free Delivery‚Äô.\\\\n5. Zero Cost Of Switching:\\\\nThe biggest problem with hyperlocal startups like this is the switching cost. Or should we say that there isn‚Äôt say.\\\\nWhat is a switching cost?\\\\nIt is the cost a customer has to pay when they decide to use another application. For example, when someone decided to use another SaaS app, the switching cost is loss of data. If they decide to play another game, they will end up losing all their progress and having to start from scratch.\\\\nEssentially, switching cost is a hidden cost that prevents a customer from using another app.\\\\nSince there is ‚ÄòZero Switching Costs‚Äô customer can have all of their competeitors on the phone and order from anyone of required. If they get one or two bad experiences, they might immediately jump to a competeitor.\\\\nIf BigBasket can also consistently deliver in under 15 minutes, Zepto is no longer a ‚Äòmust-have‚Äô but a ‚ÄòGood to have‚Äô.\\\\n6. 10 min model is replicable:\\\\nOne big IP risk is that their min model is incredible 10 in delivery can be implemented by anyone. All they need is some capital to frontload their darkstore and they‚Äôre good to go. To Retain customers in the long run, Zepto will have to keep providing on their promise of quick delivery.\\\\n7. Change in government regulations:\\\\nA lot of things need to go right for internet startups to succeed in India. Once such thing are the government regulations. As of now, Zepto can classify their drivers as partners and not employees. This allows them to pay their drivers like a consultant rather than an employee.\\\\nThis also includes all drivers who operate with Swiggy, Zomato and other delivery partners.\\\\nIf one day, the government mandates that they should also be treated as employees, it will mess with their entire P&L and might even sink the business.\\\\n8. Lose out on the waiting game\\\\nThe team behind is executing well, but can they maintain it for the long term. Old players like BigBasket are flush with an instream of capital from the TATA group. While Zepto is dependant on investor money to stay afloat. Sure, most of their darkstores eventually ramp up and start earning revenue.\\\\nBut what if players like BigBasket decide to cut Zepto on delivery costs & margins?\\\\nThis will be a long game where Zepto can only win if they are fiscally discipline and provide a stellar experience.\\\\nThese are some of the reasons we think Zepto might fail in the next 2 - 5 years.\\\\nHowever no one can predict the future and these are all just speculations up to this point. But as a growth and business person, it is your job to constantly speculate, hypothesise and play the devil‚Äôs advocate to future proof your business.\\\\nWe hope you enjoyed reading this blog.\\\\nüöÄ\\\\nIf you have any feedback, please do leave them in the TypeForm here.

The company is praised for its ability to supply groceries before the start of the year. In 2021, it collaborated with more than 86 dark store operators throughout 13 regions, resulting in more than one million deliveries. Zepto uses its network of \"cloud shops,\" or micro-warehouses, to quickly deliver orders.\\\\nIn this blog, we are discussing how two of Stanford‚Äôs talents laid the foundation for the comfort of millions.\\\\nZepto - Founders\\\\nIn April 2021, Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, two 19-year-old school friends who abandoned their studies at Stanford University, co-founded Zepto, a grocery delivery service that is focused on speed of delivery.\\\\nKaivalya Vohra the CTO, founded a start-up called KiranaKart, but then left Stanford and also attended Y Combinator along with Aadit.\\\\nAadit Palicha CEO of Zepto, co-founded KiranaKart and founded his first company when he was only 17. He too left Stanford to concentrate on building Zepto.\\\\nAs a result, they have transformed Zepto into an authority in the rapidly growing quick commerce market in India.\\\\nZepto - Journey\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s narrative began during the COVID-19 pandemic. Zepto originated from the constraints of their dwellings. Groceries and other necessities would arrive in a few days due to an increase in demand for delivery services, leaving a gap for prompt delivery. Zepto was consequently developed using all of this knowledge.\\\\nThese youngsters worked closely together on numerous initiatives, including a kid-friendly ride-hailing service, before being unexpectedly arrested in their Mumbai homes due to COVID-19 regulations. As the virus spread, grocery delivery local authorities considered important still allowed throughout most of the country, but the two struggled to collect their supplies as the sickness worsened.\\\\nZepto - Mission\\\\nZepto seeks to reduce delivery times, whereas KiranaKart, their first firm, attempted to make delivery of groceries easier for Kiranas.\\\\nZepto Marketing Strategy\\\\nOnline grocery delivery is not a novel concept. Already, startups like Blinkit and Dunzo are offering these services. Zepto\\\\\\'s 10-minute grocery and other goods delivery service sets it apart from all of its rivals. Zepto is the first company in the grocery delivery market to offer a 10-minute grocery delivery service; you may have heard of Zomato Instant, which delivers meals in 10 minutes.\\\\nAlthough the concept of 10-minute grocery delivery is novel, it was not a simple task to put into practice. Zepto established the idea of the dark store model to keep its promise to deliver groceries within the allotted period. The dark store functions similarly to Zepto\\\\\\'s fulfillment center in that it is effective despite being closed to the general public yet sufficient for the fulfillment of orders.\\\\nThe company uses artificial intelligence to pick, pack, and deliver products quickly and efficiently. A tablet-wielding employee is tasked with picking up and packing orders placed by customers in under sixty seconds. It indicates that your order is being prepared for dispatch at the moment you make the payment. The organization states that their average delivery time is 8 minutes and 40 seconds.\\\\nThe company delivers its dark store goods within a 3-kilometer radius, and it doesn\\\\\\'t charge its delivery boy more for being late. Zepto\\\\\\'s USP-its 10-minute delivery allows them to compete with well-funded fast-commerce behemoths like Swiggy, Instamart, and Blinkit.\\\\nZepto - Investors and Funding\\\\nDate |\\\\nRound |\\\\nAmount |\\\\n|\\\\nAugust30,2024 |\\\\nSeries G |\\\\n$340 million |\\\\n|\\\\nJune 21, 2024 |\\\\nSeries F |\\\\n$665 million |\\\\n|\\\\nNov 8, 2023 |\\\\nSeries E |\\\\n$31.3 million |\\\\n|\\\\nAug 25, 2023 |\\\\nSeries E |\\\\n$200 million |\\\\n|\\\\nMay 2, 2022 |\\\\nSeries D |\\\\n$200 million |\\\\n|\\\\nDec 20, 2021 |\\\\nSeries C |\\\\n$100 million |\\\\n|\\\\nOct 31, 2021 |\\\\nSeries B |\\\\n$60 million |\\\\n|\\\\nMar 22, 2021 |\\\\nSeries A |\\\\n$6.5 million |\\\\nAadit Palicha Net Worth\\\\nAccording to the IIFL Wealth Harun India Rich List 2022, Aadit Palicha Net Worth is about Rs.1200 crore.\\\\nKaivalya Vohra Net Worth\\\\nKaivalya Vohra Net Worth is Rs.1000 crore.\\\\nZepto - Challenges\\\\nZepto has had several difficulties, one of which involved allegations of misconduct by investors and founders within the fast commerce delivery firm. Ansh Nanda, an alleged co-founder of the company, said that Nexus Ventures and the other cofounders pressured him to give up his ownership of the company. Nanda pursued this further, filing a formal complaint against Zepto\\\\\\'s co-founders and Nexus Ventures partner Suvir Sujan. But the co-founders quickly filed an appeal with the Delhi High Court in response to the same. Zepto is the third firm that Nexus has invested in and where a co-founder has been identified in a Federal Investigation Report. Acko and YoloBus were two further businesses that dealt with earlier.\\\\nZepto - Future Plans\\\\nMajor Indian cities, such as Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Ghaziabad, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, and Kolkata, are currently served by Zepto\\\\\\'s operations. Zepto intends to be profitable by the year 2024, so in it to do so, it has big ambitions for expanding both its distribution network and the number of its dark stores. Eventually, the company wants to go public, and in the next two to three years, an IPO is planned. Zepto, with a strategy focus on elevated key leaders and ongoing growth, is well-positioned to maintain its position as a major player in the quick-commerce sector.\\\\nAccording to many press sources dated October 9, 2023, Zepto, which was declared the first unicorn of 2023, intends to surpass Rs. 10,000 crore in total sales in the coming months.\\\\nZepto - Competitors\\\\n- Swiggy Instamart\\\\n- Big Basket\\\\n- Blinkit\\\\nZepto - Growth\\\\nZepto made Rs.142.3 crore in sales in FY22, the year it began operations. But in the same fiscal year, the firm also suffered losses totaling Rs.390.3 crore. Zepto started operations in April 2021, and in FY22, their total expenses came to Rs.532.7 crore.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s fiscal year ended on March 31, 2023, had a 3.35-fold increase in net loss.

Additionally, Zepto is up against already well-known brands such as Swiggy Instamart, BigBasket, and Blinkit which also provide fast grocery delivery services.\\\\nThe startup faced enormous losses at first but has been on a rapid revenue growth path which is expected to culminate in profitability by the year 2024. While it considers its listing plans through expansion into new territories, Zepto will hold sway over this booming quick commerce segment.\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto Business Model | How Zepto Makes Money\\\\nüîçInsightsThe convenience of Internet food delivery services was greatly enhanced during the pandemic. The dominant player in the online grocery delivery app and company market is influencing users\\\\\\' habits.\\\\nOnline shopping is becoming increasingly common among consumers. As a result, more and more delivery services, like Zepto, have launched their services to meet the ever-increasing demands of their clients for lightning-fast delivery. You should be familiar with the Zepto business model if you are looking to enter the market.\\\\nThe supermarket delivery industry is booming, thank goodness, because it requires less time, effort, and money than other industries. In 2020, the projected value of the online grocery business was $2.9 billion. Through this article, we will go over the basics of Zepto, including its business model and how it generates revenue.\\\\nAbout Zepto\\\\nZepto, founded in 2021 by Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, two former Stanford University students, is a platform for quick commerce that provides a grocery delivery service within 10 minutes. Fast grocery delivery was the driving force for the founding of the firm. Zepto boasts delivery to major cities like Bengaluru, Lucknow, Delhi, Chennai, etc., from its Mumbai headquarters. The original company, Kiranakart Technologies Private Limited, was turned off into Zepto by its founders.\\\\nZepto Business Model\\\\nThe \"dark store model\" serves as the foundation for Zepto\\\\\\'s business model. This involves setting up delivery-only warehouse-style stores in residential regions. The shops sell a variety of products, and the sole way for buyers to place orders is through the Zepto India website or app. Across multiple regions, Zepto now has more than eighty-six dark storefronts. Dark businesses are great for quick shipping, but they may crash under heavy traffic. However, Zepto created an AI-driven system to assist with selecting, packing, and shipping to avoid sacrificing quality or service. Zepto can provide an extensive product line at rock-bottom prices because of this technology, which guarantees a seamless transition from choosing to packaging to delivery.\\\\nZepto India can provide a fast delivery service thanks to the convenience of having outlets close to customers\\\\\\' homes, which is an advantage of the Zepto business model. The elimination of the necessity for employees to utilize the store also allows the company to run with a reduced headcount.\\\\nHow Zepto Makes Money | Zepto Revenue Model\\\\nA little commission is charged for each order placed using the Zepto Grocery app in India. Helping to pay the costs of running the app and ensuring that consumers have a great experience, this commission is usually 2-3% of the total order amount.\\\\nWith almost $1.3 billion raised across eight rounds, Zepto is certainly a no-money lightweight, making it the first unicorn startup of 2023.\\\\nIn recent times, the Zepto business model has experienced tremendous expansion. Their incomes increased by 800% while their burn rate per order reduced by 5%. The reason for this rise is that Zepto boasts a 50% growth rate per month.\\\\nHere‚Äôs an easy-to-understand version of Zepto‚Äôs revenue model:\\\\n- Sales of Products: Zepto makes money by selling groceries, home goods, and personal care items on its website.

In FY24, Zepto\\\\\\'s operating revenue saw a growth of about 120%, reaching INR 4,454 crore.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s losses saw a slight decrease of 2% in FY24, to INR 1,248.6 crore from INR 1,272 crore in FY23.\\\\nUSP Of Zepto\\\\nCustomers in a rush will be enticed by Zepto\\\\\\'s promise of ultra-fast delivery‚Äîa mere 10 minutes‚Äîsince the company dominates this segment.\\\\nZepto has been aggressively growing its presence in key Indian cities, particularly in metro and big urban areas, to guarantee the quickest delivery times imaginable.\\\\nZepto SWOT Analysis\\\\nZepto Strength\\\\n- Zepto can process orders more quickly and efficiently thanks to its dark store and speedy packaging.

There is a limit on their ability to invest in marketing or expand operations due to limited human, or infrastructure resources.\\\\nZepto Opportunities\\\\n- Zepto may explore opportunities to extend its business operations internationally by entering new markets and expanding its clientele on a global scale.\\\\n- When new technology or industry trends emerge, Zepto may have opportunities to expand its product and service offerings or create innovative solutions.\\\\nZepto Threats\\\\n- Rules and regulations or the need for regulations and developments pertinent to Zepto\\\\\\'s sector can complicate compliance and increase operational expenses.\\\\n- To retain customers over the long term, Zepto must fulfill its word and deliver on time every time. Failing on this line means a massive loss of business.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s founders assert that the additional acquisitions will strengthen the company\\\\\\'s ability to connect with customers and improve its level of service. As of this very moment, Zepto is operational in the metros of India. In any case, the company has not disclosed its consumer calculation; however, several sources claim that Zepto is growing at a rate of 200% per month.\\\\nFor a company to achieve success, it takes a lot of things, and Zepto has everything.

These challenges stem from both urban logistics and evolving regulatory frameworks that could affect future operations.\\\\nUrban Logistics and Infrastructure Constraints\\\\nZepto‚Äôs rapid expansion necessitates efficient urban logistics, yet it faces serious obstacles in this area. Urban congestion and inadequate delivery networks present frequent challenges in delivery, hindering the company‚Äôs ability to maintain speedy service. The unique demands of quick-commerce, which often promise deliveries within 10-15 minutes, require a robust logistical setup. High operational costs and complexities exacerbate this situation, compelling the company to rethink its approach and refocus priorities.\\\\nPotential Regulatory Hurdles\\\\nAlongside logistical issues, Zepto must navigate a complex array of regulatory issues. In India, regulations around foreign direct investment (FDI), goods and services tax (GST) compliance, and data privacy create additional layers of operational difficulties. These regulatory hurdles not only elevate operational costs but also necessitate compliance adaptations, which can slow down the company‚Äôs expansion efforts. The ability to maneuver these evolving regulations will be critical for Zepto‚Äôs sustained success in the market.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nThe Zepto business model has significantly transformed the grocery delivery landscape with its focus on speed and efficiency. By leveraging dark stores and an innovative 10-minute delivery strategy, Zepto stands out in the competitive market, driven by a commitment to quick commerce. The remarkable achievement of a 200% rise in price within just 11 months reflects the trust and confidence investors have in this forward-thinking approach to on-demand grocery services.\\\\nAs Zepto continues to solidify its position in the industry, boasting a 60% customer retention rate, the company is well-poised for future growth. Key strategies, including expanding dark store networks and enhancing user experience through technology, will be vital to overcoming the challenges in urban logistics and consumer preferences. With a valuation of $900 million and substantial backing from prominent investors, Zepto is paving the way for the future of grocery delivery.\\\\nIn facing competition from established players, maintaining high-quality service and quick delivery times will be essential for Zepto. Innovation in its operational model and strategic partnerships with local grocery stores will not only enhance its product selection but also further its mission of becoming a leading player in the grocery delivery sector. As consumer expectations evolve, Zepto‚Äôs commitment to efficiency and a diverse range of products will undoubtedly reshape the future of grocery delivery for years to come.\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto is a quick commerce grocery startup that has grown to $100 Million ARR+ in a matter of less than 2 years.

What is Zepto‚Äôs Business Model?\\\\nThere‚Äôs both a simple and a complex way of introducing Zepto‚Äôs Business Model.\\\\nIn simple words - You order groceries from Zepto and they deliver it to your location. They make money out of this process.\\\\nLet‚Äôs say that you have some visitors home. You want some sweets and a packet of chips to serve your guests. So you would go to Zepto, choose all the items you want to order, pay for it and get it in under 10 minutes.\\\\nBut here‚Äôs everything Zepto has to do to get those product to your home in under 10 mins ‚è¨\\\\nRent a warehouse and assemble their dark store\\\\nHire delivery executives to deliver your order\\\\nHire folks to handle all the packing, arranging & all other operational tasks inside the warehouse\\\\nHire folks to handle support when things don‚Äôt go as planned\\\\nSpeak to local suppliers to get the groceries and other supplies to their dark store\\\\nBuild an app to display all the items for the customers\\\\nSpeak to UPI aggregators, banks & other financial institutions to setup seamless payment systems for you\\\\nBuild in-house systems to communicate your order to the operational staff\\\\nBuild in-house systems to help the delivery executive pickup orders and deliver them safely\\\\n& so much more‚Ä¶.\\\\nWhatever you see on your smartphone is only possible because of a ton of moving parts that seem to be seamlessly fixed with each other. This is the very simple answer to Zepto‚Äôs Business Model ü§üüèº\\\\nTo understand the complex version of Zepto‚Äôs business model, you can jump to the relevant section using the quick links below\\\\nTo breakdown this craziness behind the 10 min delivery, our team downloaded Zepto and made a quick order. We made sure that the order contained a mix of meat, fruits & milk (their highest margin items). Zepto delivered this order in less than 13 minutes!\\\\nWe also looked at a ton of user interviews and founder interviews on YouTube to understand the Zepto business model in depth.\\\\nEverything you see here is a result of mix of original research gathered from the internet and the users of Zepto. Here are the 5 key pieces that allow Zepto to deliver your order in 10 minutes or less!\\\\n1. Darkstores & Microwarehouses:\\\\nDarkstores are physical warehouses where all the items you see on the Zepto app are placed in. When you order anything, a Zepto delivery executive picks up all your items from one of these dark stores and brings it to you.\\\\nUnlike traditional retail stores, you cannot go to a dark store and buy your grocery items. Dark stores can only be accessed by Zepto‚Äôs team members and their vendors.\\\\nDark stores are the sole reason why Zepto is able to deliver some orders in under 10 minutes. By being in close proximity to a dense urban are, they are able to deliver your order quickly.\\\\nFor example, let‚Äôs consider Indiranagar in Bangalore.\\\\nBy placing a warehouse in this location, Zepto will be able to service all these neighbourhoods in under 10 minutes.\\\\nIf the order frequency and retention is good, the dark stores will max out almost instantly. Then they could either add more deliver partners to the same dark store or simplu open up one more dark store nearby!\\\\nWhat happens if that dark store also reaches a bottleneck?\\\\nIn that case, Zepto opens up another dark store to meet demands.\\\\nBut thanks to their experienced leadership team, all these expansion decisions are backed by data. They take into account geography, future growth potential, traffic, weather, driver availability & much more before they even think about opening a new dark store.\\\\n2. Super Quick Packaging\\\\nThe founding principles of Zepto has always been impeccable operations backed by custom built software. That‚Äôs how they scaled their first store and that‚Äôs the same principle they‚Äôre using for all their stores across India.\\\\nOnce you place an order, an operations executive inside their warehouse will get two things\\\\nA list of all the items in your orders\\\\nA map to navigate themselves inside the warehouse to pickup all the items in the least amount of time\\\\nThe second point is what truly allows Zepto to become a kingpin on operational efficiency üöÄ. As their CTO Kaivalya Arora says, ‚ÄòWe have designed the process to make sure the entire order is dispacted in 60 - 90 seconds‚Äô\\\\nThis means that the rest of the time is entirely spent on the last mile delivery, thereby easing some pressure on the delivery partner.\\\\nThis brings us onto our third point\\\\n3. Internal Structure of the warehouses\\\\nOperational efficiency is the name of the game when it comes to any operations heavy business. And Zepto achieves operational efficiency in a class of its own üßóüèº‚ôÄÔ∏è.\\\\nThe operations have streamlined the entire warehouse with a data led approach. They‚Äôve looked at the items which move the quickest and have placed it closer to the entrance. Groceries which are not frequenlty ordered are de-prioritised and placed at the back.\\\\nThe creative below will give you an idea of how a darkstore might be structured based on the order frequency of different items. Although this structure is just an example and is subject to change based on several other factors.\\\\nBut Multiply this structural formula with item size, refrigeration needs, fragility & you will get a repeatable model of how to design all your warehouses at scale üöÄ\\\\nFor example, fruits & vegetables are one of their most important and highest margin categories. Hence they have decided to place them in shelves closer to the entrance, where they‚Äôre very easy grab and place into delivery bags.\\\\nTo draw parallels, this is very similar to how the founders of McDonalds designed their Kitchen to complete customer orders in less than two minutes ü§Ø\\\\nIf you haven‚Äôt seen ‚ÄòThe Founder‚Äô on Netflix, this is an open call to see it ASAP. If you‚Äôre working in an operations heavy business or interested in building one, please remember that operational efficiency is crucial for your long term success.\\\\nBut, how do you design superfast systems even when human decisions are part of the system?\\\\nA human operator has to look at the order and decide the chronological order of items in the delivery bag. This takes time and there is also the risk of human errors. Items might be missed or fragile items might end up getting placed at the bottom of the bag (No one likes to have their eggs & tomatoes crushed under a watermelon ‚òπÔ∏è)\\\\nSo the team came up with a pretty simple solution - Give a tablet like device to each operations executive in the darkstore. It works like a Google map, guiding the executive to pickup the items placed in the warehouse.\\\\nOnce the operator is assigned an order, they are told where and how to pick each item in a chronological order.\\\\nTheir CTO Kaivalya says ‚ÄúWe wanted to remove human decisions as much as possible. So each of our executives have a handheld software device driving them through the most optimal pathway‚Äù\\\\nThis system works like a charm and has allowed them to exponentially open new dark stores across India üöÄ, while maintaining quality control.\\\\n4. Incredibly short distances to delivery:\\\\nBigBasket took anywhere between 3 hours to a day to deliver a bag of groceries, while Zepto does it in 10 minutes. A lot of this speed is heavily owed to a warehouse that is present in close proximity to an urban location. This is just simple physics bringing down the time of the last mile delivery.\\\\nSince the distances are closer, the delivery executives are also able to fulfill their orders quicker. Moreover with customers who order frequently, Zepto can assign the same set of delivery partners to fullfil their orders. Since they are well acquainted with the location of the customers, this brings the Time To Deliver even lower üëçüèº.\\\\n5. Driver‚Äôs Familiarity with their locality:\\\\nThe operations team at Swiggy use incredibly sophisticated Machine Learning models to bring down the total deliver time. Right from choosing which partner gets which order to how many order each partner picks up.\\\\nThis allows the delivery partner to\\\\nPickup multiple order and deliver them on the way\\\\nDeliver one order and pickup an order from a nearby hotel\\\\nTo even give you a rough estimation, Swiggy has to calculate four things before assigning a delivery partner to your order.\\\\nThis gets more complex when the delivery executive has to pickup one more order or has to deliver one more order on the way to your house.\\\\nIf you thought that was complex, think about assigning a delivery partner at random. Sometimes they might be familiar with your area. Sometimes they might not be familiar with your locality. Now combine this with traffic and other humane errors!\\\\nWith Zepto, some of these problems like Prep Time are naturally removed due to the nature of the business. Since the drivers are also operating in a familiar locality, the first mile & last mile times are brought down significantly.\\\\nHere‚Äôs how the Zepto would calculate time for a delivery partner who‚Äôs already at the darkstore\\\\nThe human factor is definitely one of the bigger advantages of Zepto. In a matter of weeks, the delivery partners become familiar with each road and each shortcut. Familiarity breeds speed and the delivery partners get quick with time.\\\\nIf you‚Äôre interested about how Swiggy does their driver routing, please do give this and this a read üëçüèº\\\\n2. How does Zepto make money üí∏?\\\\nWe‚Äôve seen how Zepto operates from a micro and a macro view. They store groceries in a darkstore and deliver them with the help of their delivery partners. But all this seems like a costly affair to run. They have to pay rent for each darkstore, salaries for darkstore operators & payments for delivery partners. These are fixed operating costs to Zepto.\\\\nAdd this on top of the tech, product & marketing costs, it‚Äôll give you a fair idea of the amount of money required to keep Zepto alive. So how does Zepto earn money selling groceries?\\\\nHere are the five ways they are currently earning money ü§ë, along with one potential way Zepto they can earn money in the future üöÄ\\\\n1. Margins on each individual product:\\\\nThe most common way grocery delivery startups earn money is on the margins of each individual product. This model is similar to the retailers who buy goods at a lower cost from distributors and sell it at a higher price ‚úÖ\\\\nFor example, let‚Äôs assume that Zepto sells a kg of onion for a price of 24 rupees. They earn margins on this by buying a large quantity from a distributor at a lower price.\\\\nWe went to the internet and checked for prices of onions from distributors. The prices range from anywhere between 10 rupees/ kg to 20 rupees/ kg.\\\\nIf they are able to tie up with a buyer at the lowest price, this is definitely a win win for both of them. Because Zepto gets onion at a lower price and the distributor also gets his order fulfilled almost frequently leading to repeatable revenue numbers.\\\\nFor starters we did some calculations as to how much revenue Zepto could earn from just one warehouse and from onion üß†\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume that Zepto orders 100 kg of onion for one of its warehouses in Bandra every day.\\\\nThe price of one kilogram of onion comes around to 10 rupees.\\\\nSo let‚Äôs assume that the total cost to Zepto along with transportation is 1200 rupees.\\\\nLet‚Äôs also assume an ideal state where they are able to sell the entire 100 kg over the same day.\\\\nWe know that zepto currently sells onion at a price of 24 rupees/ kg.\\\\nNow that‚Äôs 2400 rupees before taxes & other charges.\\\\nNot bad for 100 kgs of onion sold in just one darkstore.\\\\nAccording to their CTO, Kaivalya -‚ÄùPotatoes, Onion, Tomatoes are some of our highest selling items on Zepto. Fruits & vegetables also happen to be one of the highest margin items on our platform‚Äù\\\\nOnion is just one category here. One look into Zepto and you‚Äôll see hundreds of vegetables, fruits, and quick perishable items, all of which are high margin items on Zepto!\\\\n2. Handling Charges\\\\nHandling charge is the fee collected by Zepto to organise, pack and dispatch the items on your list. We clicked on the ‚Äòinformation‚Äô button to understand more about this handling charge and we were thrown the following message - ‚ÄúHandling charge is levied to ensure the products are handled, packed & dispatched safely‚Äù\\\\nWe tried to see if a handling charge is levied by all grocery delivery platforms in India\\\\nSwiggy Instamart - Yes, they had a handling charge\\\\nBigBasket NOW - They had something called a delivery token, but it seemed very similar to this handling charge\\\\nBlinkit - Surprisingly, they did not have a handling charge\\\\nWe figured that the handling charge was not a set standard across all grocery delivery platforms. So this is something that is levied by platforms in different ways.\\\\n3. Delivery Charges\\\\nThis is the second bigger piece of solving the profitability equation for most delivery grocery startups. Delivery charge is a big incredibly important for solving profitability because\\\\nNo matter the size of the order, Zepto has to pay the same delivery fee to their delivery partner\\\\nBut high delivery charges can also be a reason why users stop buying from Zepto\\\\nThe key here is to find the balance between waiving delivery charges and growing profitably üí™üèº. Zepto has solved this problem by choosing to charge customers for orders with a low value basket size. However if you break a certain threshold, you‚Äôll unlock the option to get a ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô\\\\nIncreasing the threshold to unlock free delivery does two things\\\\nIncreases the AOV of each order by encouraging customer to order more\\\\nImprove revenue by charging delivery fee on orders with low AOV\\\\nThe net benefit is aimed at increasing overall revenue from the ‚Äòdelivery fee‚Äô lever. But it might also reduce the overall order frequency for certain ICPs who are Power users. High delivery fees might discourage users who use Zepto to order everything at the last minute.\\\\nHence this a profit lever the ‚ÄòGrowth Team‚Äô must constantly tweak and experiment with data!\\\\nBut the fact is that people are tier 1 cities are increasingly favouring CONVENIENCE >>> MONEY. Our hypothesis is that most folks won‚Äôt mind paying a delivery fee of 25 - 50 get their order delivered.\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume that Sheila orders from Zepto 6 times a week\\\\n‚Üí Even if she gets 3 free deliveries a week, we still have 3 deliveries where Zepto earns a revenue\\\\n‚Üí If she‚Äôs paying 35/ delivery, that‚Äôs 105 rupees for a week.\\\\n‚Üí Extrapolate that across a month and Zepto has earned a revenue of 420 rupees.\\\\n‚Üí Assuming there are 100 customers like her in one dark store, Zepto has just earned 42,000 rupees just from deliveries.\\\\nYou should note that these these numbers are highly speculative and can vary a lot. But you get the gist. Done right, Zepto can find a balance between earning from delivery charges while also maintaining the user frequency ü´Ç\\\\nOne interesting fact to note that if your order is less than 50 rupees, Zepto levies a fee of ‚ÄòSmall Cart Fee‚Äô of Rupees 35. This will incentivise the user to add more to their cart quite naturally!\\\\n4. Product Customisations:\\\\nUser Research is something we push actively in the GrowthX experience. Before you hypothesize any solution, you should always seek to understand your users and their problems.\\\\nIn Zepto‚Äôs case, it‚Äôs safe to say that they‚Äôve identified their customers and their problems incredibly well. One good example is under their fruits and vegetables section\\\\nRight from peeled onion, to cut carrots & loose corn. They have identified ways to take existing vegetables, customize them and increase their prices üöÄ\\\\nFor example:\\\\n500 grams of carrot costs 45 rupees.\\\\nBringing it down to 100 grams this costs just 9 rupees.\\\\nBut 200 grams of peeled carrots costs 53 rupees on Zepto.\\\\nBringing this down to 100 grams costs a whopping 26 rupees\\\\nBy simply washing and cutting up the carrots, they have found ways to increase their margins on their products.\\\\nSimple economics shows a 300% increase in price ü§Ø just by customising the product a bit.\\\\nSure you‚Äôll have to buy expensive machinery or employ people to help with these customisation. But if Zepto is able to achieve good volumes, this cost will also go down as it‚Äôs fixed!\\\\nZepto definitely nailed ‚ÄòPeople don‚Äôt buy your product, they buy the solution that can be achieved with your product‚Äô ü§òüèº\\\\n5. Product Ads:\\\\nProduct Ads are a proven way to earn predictable revenue in most e-commerce and marketplace businesses. Zepto also pulls this off Product Ads in a flawless manner\\\\nAlmost everyone in the grocery space uses product ads as a monetary lever.\\\\nThe concept is simple: If you‚Äôre a retailer, you can give money to Zepto to feature your products at the top of certain searches & categories.\\\\nFor example, Bru features their ‚ÄòBru Instant Pure Coffee Jar‚Äô at the first position for the keyword ‚Äòcoffee.\\\\n6. Membership:\\\\nThis is a model Zepto hasn‚Äôt experimented yet, but proves to a very solid model for predictable revenue growth.

This growth is possible because they had a structured approach to growth in the first place. Be it creating marketing copies or opening up new darkstores, everything has a structure in place.\\\\nIn this section we will create a structured Growth strategy for Zepto to reach a business goal in a specific period of time.\\\\n1. Who is Zepto‚Äôs Ideal customer?\\\\nBefore we nail down on Zepto‚Äôs ICP, let‚Äôs look at a couple of practical use cases of Zepto\\\\nYou have a few visitors at home and you need to serve them snacks. Maybe you order some fruits and snack items on Zepto for your visitors\\\\nYou are prepping for breakfast when you realise the batter you have has expired. So you go to Zepto and order for some fresh ID dosa batter\\\\nYou are preparing lunch when you realise that you don‚Äôt have any onions left for dinner. Maybe you order some onions along with a fresh set of groceries for the next three days\\\\nYou feel the need to snack and want some biscuits and chips. So you go to Zepto to order some snacks along with essential groceries for the week\\\\nYou step into the washroom to brush your teeth, only to realise you are out of paste. You quickly open Zepto and get some paste delivered in the next 10 minutes\\\\nThese are just a tiny subset of the use cases of Zepto. Also most of these examples were just around groceries. Zepto also has a ton of other sub categories like\\\\nCleaning Essentials\\\\nMakeup items\\\\nBaby care\\\\nBath & Body care\\\\nElectricals & Accessories\\\\n& much more\\\\nA simple probability check will show you that the use cases are in the thousands (and growing as Zepto plans to add new categories ü§òüèº). Before you build any growth strategy, you need to find a way to bucket these millions of users & use cases into something consumable.\\\\nThis look into Zepto‚Äôs ideal customer is nothing perfect. But it will give you a solid foundation into Zepto‚Äôs primary users.\\\\nWe have borrowed these insights from the assignment submitted by one of our members - Aadeesh Deshpande (GX12). He is currently working as Associate Director - Business Development and Key Accounts at MX Player.

This table is nowhere close to perfect. We‚Äôre sure that the growth team inside Zepto will have more data points on this.\\\\nBut this table gives you a basic overview into\\\\nWho are buying from Zepto?\\\\nWhy are they buying from Zepto?\\\\nWhat are they buying from Zepto?\\\\nAnd their major blockers to spend more on Zepto\\\\nWith these characteristics in mind, let‚Äôs take a peek into the market sizing of Zepto üëáüèº\\\\n2. Understanding the market (TAM, SAM, SOM)\\\\nIn an interview with Master‚Äôs Union, their CTO Kaivalya Arora says ‚Äúwe went from 5 to 77+ dark stores from Sep to Dec, 2022‚Äù\\\\nThis massive growth is backed by some of the top investors in the market like Nexus, Glade Brook & YCombinator. This is even after there are tons of grocery startups in the market like Instamart, Blinkit and let‚Äôs not forget Tata‚Äôs BigBasket!\\\\nThis is possible because of the nature & scale of the grocery business in India üáÆüá≥\\\\nTheir CEO points the scale of the grocery & essential industry in a beautiful way - ‚ÄúDmart has built a $40 Billion dollar business in a matter of 20 years. If we can even capture a portion of that volume, we can build a profitable business effectively‚Äù\\\\nSo the question is\\\\n‚ùì\\\\nHow big is the grocery market and how much market share is available for Zepto?\\\\nIndia is a massive country with a total population of 1.5 billion people ü§Ø\\\\nBut Zepto cannot cater to this entire base as most of them are located in Tier 2+ cities & rural areas. Maybe Zepto will tap everyone in India (in the future) or maybe we‚Äôll have a Tier 2+ focused startup like Meesho focusing on just that market!\\\\nBut for the foreseeable future, Zepto will only be focusing on the folks living in Tier1+ cities with Annual salaries greater than 10 lakh/ annum\\\\nKartik Narang (GX10), a fellow GrowthX member and Capabilities & Insights Analyst McKinsey laid out this TAM calculation in an incredible manner in one of his acquisition assignmentsüöÄ\\\\nCondition\\\\nCalculation\\\\nTotal Population in Tier 1 Cities in India\\\\n70 Million\\\\nPercentage of People between 20 & 40 years of age\\\\n40%\\\\nTotal Population in Tier 1 cities between the age of 20 - 40\\\\n28 Million\\\\nPercentage of Annual Income greater than 10 lakhs\\\\n40%\\\\nTotal Population in Tier 1 cities between the age 20 - 40 with Annual Income greater than 10 lakhs\\\\n11.2 Million\\\\nAverage number of people per household\\\\n4\\\\nTotal Number of houses that can be reached\\\\n11.2/ 4 ‚áí 3 Million households\\\\n„Ö§\\\\n„Ö§\\\\nThe total TAM in terms of the number of households can be assumed anywhere between 3 to 7 million based on the variations in the following categories\\\\nSwati Poddar (GX9), another fellow GrowthX member and PM at Walmart has smartly converted this into revenue numbers by multiplying the TAM with the average spend on groceries for each household. This was also an acquisition assignment as part of the GrowthX learning experience.\\\\nüí°\\\\nBy the way, the depth you see here is just a feeler of the depth we teach at GrowthX üí´\\\\nGrowthX is an invite-only club of over 3000 members who are product, marketing, and business leaders, and founders from top internet-first companies like Google, Canva, CRED, Stripe, Netflix, and more üíé\\\\nWe teach our members how to scale revenues via frameworks that can be applied starting next Monday morning. The GrowthX Membership is built on 3 core pillars:\\\\n1. Learning experience: Where you learn the science of revenue-led growth with frameworks actionable the next Monday morning.\\\\n2. Curated community: Where you access a safe space for you to soundboard anything that is stressing you at work.\\\\n3. Career outcomes: Over 35% of members are founders & are able to hire growth teams to scale revenue for their companies while operators are able to get into breakout leadership roles.\\\\nExplore GrowthX Membership üèÜ\\\\nBy Swati‚Äôs calculation with a TAM of 7 Million and an average household grocery spend of 10,000 rupees/ month, the revenue TAM comes down to 704 crores/ month\\\\nWe can say that Swati‚Äôs TAM is way different from Kartik‚Äôs TAM Calculations. But this doesn‚Äôt mean that one of their calculations are wrong.\\\\nTAM calculation is all about making informed assumptions with the data we have in mind\\\\nIn Swati‚Äôs case, she considered the average number of people/ household as 2.5. Hence the major difference in the overall TAM number. In essence, TAM is just to give you an idea about the potential size of the market. It is always changing and is never a number set in stone üöÄ\\\\nHere‚Äôs how the TAM Range will look based on same average household grocery spend of 10,000 rupees/ month ‚è¨\\\\nTAM (In Terms of number of households)\\\\n3 Million\\\\n4 Million\\\\n5 Million\\\\n6 Million\\\\n7 Million\\\\nAvg Household Spend On Groceries\\\\n10,000\\\\n10,000\\\\n10,000\\\\n10,000\\\\n10,000\\\\nTAM (In Terms of Total Achievable Revenue)\\\\n300 Crores/ month\\\\n400 Crores/ month\\\\n500 Crores/ month\\\\n600 Crores/ month\\\\n700 Crores/ month\\\\nWhen you start gathering more data points, you can also do TAM Calculations based on different ICPs and customer segments. This can help you decide everything from Growth strategies to overall product positioning and key business decisions ü§ôüèº\\\\n3. Zepto‚Äôs Growth Strategy\\\\nBased on this market & ICP research, we can create a Growth Strategy for Zepto. The growth strategy contains five main levers which are\\\\nAcquisition\\\\nOnboarding\\\\nEngagement & Retention\\\\nMonetisation\\\\nBuilding a Growth Team\\\\nBut all of these levers don‚Äôt mean anything when you don‚Äôt understand the core goal.\\\\nWe have built this growth strategy using the same foundations we teach our members as part of the GrowthX Learning Experience. If you also want to create structured and outcome driven growth model like this for your startup, check out our experience here üí™üèº\\\\nWhat is Zepto‚Äôs goal for the next 2 - 5 years?\\\\nIf you ask us, we definitely have no clue. So that‚Äôs why we are going to hypothesize their goals based on two things\\\\nTheir current growth numbers\\\\nFounder Interviews on YouTube\\\\nLooking at both, one things becomes very clear. One of their current goals is to grow as quickly as possible. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that they don‚Äôt have profitability in mind. They are looking to grow their revenue numbers with the goal of achieving optimal profitability in the next two to five years.\\\\nThey also understand that anyone can copy their business model and quickly overtake them. So their core goal is to also open new dark stores across various markets, establish their presence, gain users & use that as their MOAT!\\\\nIn simple words, you could hypothesise their goal as\\\\n‚Üí Expand to all Tier 1 cities in India and achieve a revenue of XXXX in YYYY number of years\\\\nSince we don‚Äôt have any insider information about Zepto, we‚Äôre just going to assume the revenue number as $500 Million ARR and year as 3. We assume this because Their CEO mentions in one the interviews that they had easily crossed $100 Million ARR a while back.\\\\nSince acquiring new users is going to play a key role, we are going to prioritise Acquisition as our first lever\\\\nSince retaining these users and getting them back is also key to revenue growth & profitabilty, we‚Äôre going to prioritise Engagement & Retention as our second lever\\\\nSince it‚Äôs a mobile app, we need to make sure any user who‚Äôs downloading it, actually ends up using Zepto. We‚Äôre focusing on our Onboarding lever as the third priority\\\\nFinally, we cannot let profitability be an afterthought. It also needs a bit of focus fro the get go. So we‚Äôre going with our Monetisation lever as the fourth priority\\\\nOnce we break down all these levers, we‚Äôll get a very clear idea on how to build our Growth team. Some common questions like\\\\nWho To Hire?\\\\nWhen To Hire?\\\\nBudgets For Hiring?\\\\nWhich are must have roles and good to have roles?\\\\nNOTE: Your growth strategy is not set in stone. Based on the business goals, the market conditions and tons of other factors, your growth strategy will always be evolving. The best growth minds are always aware of this and are willing to tweak their strategies based on the macro and micro changes üöÄ.\\\\n4. Acquisition\\\\nWe have defined 4 different ICPs in the ideal customer section. Each ICP has a different set of needs and different marketing strategies that work for them.\\\\nA really good growth team understand this and will tweak their marketing strategies based on the ICP they‚Äôre trying to reach.\\\\nFor this case, we‚Äôre just going to look at ICP 1 - The ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô. These are folks in the age range of 20 - 25 and purchase everything from online grocery platforms like Instamart, Zepto & BigBasket.\\\\nWe will only create a Growth Model for this ICP. Since they have a lot of unplanned purchases, their usage frequency is also very high. Also because they are young and have a lot of disposable income, their ability & willingness to spend is also high.\\\\nThe most common acquisition channels to reach our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô are\\\\nYou can use the quick links below to jump to any specific section in our Acquisition Lever\\\\nNow let‚Äôs break down all the acquisition levers for Zepto‚Äôs growth model\\\\nOrganic\\\\nZepto‚Äôs organic strategy for the ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô has three splits. This is based on how they discover new products and where they usually spend their time on.\\\\nSearch Engine Optimisation (SEO):\\\\nSEO is the art of ranking your business when your ideal customer searches for it. Since SEO is a pull channel, you need to identify the different ways in which your customers might search for your product\\\\nHere are some common themes we were able to identify with Search Engine Optimisation.\\\\nHere‚Äôs the breakdown with some common examples\\\\nMost of the keywords here were occupied by market leaders like Amazon & BigBasket. Currently Zepto doesn‚Äôt seem to have an SEO strategy in place. It‚Äôs website is also pretty basic, displaying just information information only about their organisation.\\\\nFor starters, their main competitor BigBasket brings around 6.4 million website visitors from smartphone traffic alone. It‚Äôs the ideal time for Zepto to think about organic SEO strategies if they‚Äôre certain about building this for the long term üöÄ\\\\nTo start with SEO, they need to invest in a website strategy that ties in with their app usage. Most of their users will use Zepto on their app. But the website is primarily to build pages and capture the SEO traffic.\\\\nEventually Zepto will also have to build a full scale website like BigBasket if they want to tap into the fullscale SEO potential.\\\\nApp Store Optimisation(ASO):\\\\nSince Zepto is a mobile app first business, App Store & Play Store discovery is a high priority. App Store Optimisation is the art of ranking your app for relevant searches and in the relevant categories.\\\\nASO can also be broken down into the three types of searches, which we have broken down in the Whimsical below\\\\nApart from search, you also need to ensure your app is free from technical glitches and bugs. Pair this with a healthy number of positive reviews, your app will also be displayed in top positions under\\\\nRelated Applications\\\\nTop Free Apps\\\\nTrending Apps\\\\netc..\\\\nYour best bet is to make sure your app\\\\nIs free from technical glitches\\\\nHas an incredible user experience\\\\nTons of Positive Reviews (Possibly 4+ stars)\\\\nSocial Media:\\\\nSocial Media is yet another untapped opportunity for Zepto. One of the reasons we suggest social media is because\\\\nSwiggy, Zomato and a lot of D2C, FMCg brands have been doubling down on Organic social for the same reasons. While it requires constant effort and a lot of experimentation to stay relevant on social, the efforts gradually pay off.\\\\nSince the ‚ÄòYoung Gun‚Äô ICPs are extremely young and spend a lot of time on social media applications, it makes perfect sense ü§òüèº\\\\nThe Social Media strategy would be a mix of long form content (For YouTube etc) and Short form content (for YouTube Shorts & Reels)\\\\nLong Form Content ‚Üí\\\\nThe general theme of long form content is to provide value first. We can start with things ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô might already be searching for. Since some of them might be living alone, some ideas could be\\\\nCooking Tips\\\\nHome Cleaning Tips\\\\nHealthy Eating Tips\\\\netc‚Ä¶.\\\\nShort Form Content ‚Üí\\\\nShort form content should focus on funny anecdotes and things these folks might find relatable.\\\\nFunny Reels\\\\nRelatable Memes\\\\nQuick Informational Videos\\\\netc‚Ä¶.\\\\nHowever considering the entire macro, social media needs to be inclusive of all ICPs. It should not just be relatable to our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô. The overall brand persona and positioning should also be in mind when creating these strategies.\\\\nZepto has had a very heavy reliance on PAID Ads to grow. It is fair given how their business is location dependant and Paid is the best channel for location based targeting.\\\\nSince PAID Ads can be customised and deployed quite quickly, it‚Äôs Time To Value from them is much quicker. Paid Ads can be divided into three sub categories\\\\nThese are advertisements that will be displayed on search engines like Google, Bing and other platforms. The targeting here is based on individual keywords, rather than just interests or demographic data üöÄ\\\\nProduct Ads:\\\\nProduct based ads which focus on specific products can be extremely useful for Zepto. They have two strategies for product base search ads\\\\nProducts that are low AOV, but high margins (fruits, vegetables etc..)\\\\nProducts that are high AOV, but low margin (Oil, Atta etc..)\\\\nProducts that have a high purchase frequency, but low AOV & ROI (Snacks, Quick Munchies)\\\\nWhich products they want to go after is entirely dependant on a strategy backed by data üíΩ\\\\nBrand Ads:\\\\nBrand Ads can be used for keywords where someone is searching for your product, but you don‚Äôt have the sub pages ready for it.\\\\nOr you can also use it to capitalise on the Inbound search terms until SEO kicks in.\\\\nBrand Ads can also be used to kick out competitors for products which Zepto thinks will give them good retention.\\\\nCompetitor Ads:\\\\nThese ads can be run over competitor pages or also be run over products which Zepto‚Äôs competitor‚Äôs are ranking for. Yet again, this can be used to capture a new market, a new product if you think they might help with your retention rates.\\\\nSocial Ads:\\\\nSocial ads come in really handy when you‚Äôre trying to target based on location, interests or both.\\\\nIf Zepto is trying to scale up each individual dark store chronologically, this is a great way to reach customers. You can target based on age, interests, gender & more based on the data platforms given by advertising platforms ü§òüèº\\\\nWe need to be mindful of two things when running social ads\\\\nWhat‚Äôs the key value proposition for this ICP?\\\\nHow do we convert that into our messaging?\\\\nWhich social platforms are they most active in?\\\\nAs we‚Äôre just focusing on the ‚ÄòYoung Gun‚Äô ICP, we also need to make sure the messaging is on point for them. Their messaging can be derived from their Key Value Propositions such as\\\\n10 Min Delivery\\\\nFresh Groceries At Your Doorstep\\\\nSave Time\\\\nHere‚Äôs how a static ad might look for them on a social media platform\\\\nHere‚Äôs an example of a dynamic ad for Zepto.\\\\nIt‚Äôs both quirky and conveys the Key Value Proposition under 15 seconds. Perfect for social media platforms\\\\nWhile running social ads, we also need to mindful of the platforms each ICP is active on. Our ICP is active on Instagram, Snapchat & Facebook which are all good platforms to start with üé¢\\\\nApp Store Ads:\\\\nSince they‚Äôre an app first platform, it makes a lot of sense to prioritise App Store Ads when you‚Äôre starting with the paid channel. The grocery market is a bit mature thanks to old players like BgBasket, Blinkit and other incumbents\\\\nSo it‚Äôs Zepto‚Äôs best bet to capitalise on the existing search volume on these platforms üöÄ\\\\nApp Store Ads can also be of two types as shown below\\\\nThese ad formats are a different beast in themselves. For the sake of keeping this short we are skipping the technicalities in this section for now.\\\\nThere‚Äôs an universal truth we need to understand before we get into Product Integrations. No app, product or business exists out there in Unison. While your customer is using your product, they are also simultaneously using multiple other products at the same time.\\\\nProduct Integration is the concept of seeking a natural fit with the products used by your users and integrating with them.\\\\nBut some ground rules before we seek Product Integrations\\\\nThe Product should not be a direct competitor to Zepto\\\\nThe Product Integration pitch should feel natural and personalised\\\\nThe product should also have good trust (as trust can be destroyed by partnering with a wrong brand)\\\\nThe product should preferably have the same or higher usage frequency than Zepto\\\\nFrom user interviews conducted by GrowthX members, we have discovered that Zepto users also use some products like UrbanClap, Netflix, Hotstar, EatFit etc‚Ä¶\\\\nHere are some interesting product integrations we can work out with the following products\\\\nUrban Company\\\\nHotstar\\\\nEatFit\\\\nThese are just some examples from the top of our head. Once you do more intense customer research, you will be able to find better products that have a better fit with your offerings.\\\\nPartnerships are lesser known ways to get your brand in front of tons of new customers. Zepto can approach partnerships in two different ways\\\\nInfluencer Partnerships\\\\nProduct Placements\\\\nEach has their merit and difference in their payback periods!\\\\nInfluencer Led Partnerships\\\\nThis essentially focuses on partnering with influencers whom your audience are also hooked into. Most of these partnerships are based on behavioural insights which can be derived from customer calls, surveys etc.\\\\nSince we‚Äôre trying to reach the ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô, we will start with the platforms they‚Äôre most active on - IG & YouTube. Step 2 is understanding the themes or which channels/ pages they follow.\\\\nWe know that this persona is focused on improving their career. So a good place to start is with channels that focus on ‚ÄòCareer specific advice‚Äô. Some of them could also be interested in cooking channels üï∫üèº.\\\\nThe main idea is to identify a theme and then double on those specific channels with a solid pitch.\\\\nProduct Placements\\\\nWeb series & movies are a great way to place your products in a subtle manner. The actor sipping on a cold coffee he ordered from Zepto. Or maybe the family member ordering something on Zepto.\\\\nThese are all subtle pitches to place your products in mainstream movies as well as smaller films & web series.\\\\nUnacademy pulled this off incredibly well with their product placements in tv series like Kota Factory, Operation MBBS etc. Product Placements should feel like natural and in sync with the plot. The core idea is to solidify Zepto as a product everyone uses casually in their life.\\\\nOffline ads probably have one of the best product-channel fits for Zepto because of their hyperlocal nature. When done right, this channel can solve for discovery for a very specific set of ICPs in one location. The best ICP to start with is our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô\\\\nHere are a couple of offline channel ideas to target ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô in their daily life\\\\nThey mostly take an Ola or Uber to reach their workplace\\\\nWe can place ads in autos & cabs behind the driver‚Äôs seat\\\\nThey might take a bus or the use the metro train\\\\nWe can also place banners in specially designated boards at these stops\\\\nThey will use the lift atleast twice a day in their office space\\\\nWe can place an ad inside the lift walls\\\\nThey will walk past the lobby in their office space (preferably an IT park)\\\\nWe can place custom booths that encourage people to download and try Zepto\\\\nOffline channels come in a variety of ways and help us target folks in a very specific locality!\\\\nFor most consumer led applications, referrals can be an incredible acquisition tool. Since our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô are highly social and tech savvy, referral can have a good product market fit for them.\\\\nAll good referral programs will nail 4 things in depth\\\\nThe reward for both the referrer and the referee\\\\nWhy will someone refer?\\\\nWhen will someone refer?\\\\nHow easy it is to refer?\\\\nEach section can use a separate page in reality. But for this guide, we‚Äôre going to focus on Zepto and our target ICP - ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô.\\\\nWhy will someone refer Zepto?\\\\nAt the heart of every successful referral program lies an incredible customer experience. The best reason someone will refer Zepto is when they have a great experience with it. A great experience is delivered when\\\\nThey get their order in under 15 minutes\\\\nThe items are fresh and undamaged\\\\nThe packaging is good\\\\nThey get exactly what they ordered for (not something different - happens frequently in grocery delivery apps)\\\\nTheir AOV of each order is high (Depth)\\\\nThey keep ordering multiple times a week (frequency)\\\\nThe idea here is to identify when someone has a good experience and then take them to the referral loop\\\\nWhen will someone refer Zepto?\\\\nThe discovery of the referral loop should always be placed in the ‚ÄòHappy Flow‚Äô of the customer.\\\\nSome examples of happy flows are\\\\nAfter a customer receives their order in under 15 minutes\\\\nAfter a customer has submitted a review\\\\nThe goal is to identify screens where the user is in a ‚ÄòHappy Flow‚Äô yet it still won‚Äôt hinder the primary goal (complete an order)\\\\nWhat is the reward?\\\\nA good reward does two things\\\\nEnables the customer to keep referring\\\\nEnables the new customers to & old customers to keep using the app\\\\nIn that frame of mind, rewards should be app specific and increase the usage of the app. Monetary rewards are good, but they prevent the users from investing the reward back into the app.\\\\nApp specific coins, coupons and dicsounts are always good currencies for a referral system. One such reward is Zepto‚Äôs ‚ÄòZepto cash‚Äô. It provides both the referrer and the referee with credits they can only use in Zepto.\\\\nHow easy is it to refer?\\\\nEase of a referral system depends on two things\\\\nDiscovery of the referral system\\\\nAbility to Track your referrals\\\\nDiscovery can be solved by showing the referral link in all the ‚ÄòHappy Flows‚Äô and also on the sidebar.\\\\nAbility to track referrals is important because it allows the referrer to understand where his referees are\\\\nHave they clicked on the link\\\\nHave the downloaded the app\\\\nHave they made their first transaction\\\\nBut building a referral program like this is resource intensive and takes up a lot of development effort (even with the use of tools!)\\\\nA good idea is to run a test to a small population before deploying it to tons of users. Some things that can be tested are\\\\nRewards for referee\\\\nRewards for referrer\\\\nPlacement of the referral link\\\\nTracking of the referral link\\\\nDifferent ways to share the referral link\\\\nHere are some metrics Zepto can track to ensure the success of it‚Äôs referral program\\\\nNumber of active users sending invites\\\\nNumber of invites per referrer\\\\nConversion rate to link clicks\\\\nConversion rate to app downloads\\\\nConversion rate to first purchase\\\\nConversion rate to first review\\\\nSo that‚Äôs all about the acquisiton strategies for Zepto ü§òüèº. Now let‚Äôs take a look into the next most important lever for Zepto‚Äôs success - E&R.\\\\nEngagement & Retention are the holy grail of building a successful product in any market. We could even go further and say, Engagement & Retention are the pillars of any successful business.\\\\nGood engagement leads to better retention.\\\\nBetter retention leads to revenue and word of mouth.\\\\nGood revenue means you can invest in the best talent, improve the product even more and rule the market\\\\nWord of mouth means that you can now acquire customers at costs that keep getting lower\\\\nAll these combine into a vicious cycle which make any product/ business successful.\\\\nWhere does retention come here?\\\\nSome of the best product teams think about retention right from the Onboarding. It‚Äôs all about helping the user become powerful with the product. Retention is never an afterthought in any successful product. When done right, retention can drive product & even business decisions.\\\\nHow does Engagement & Retention apply to our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nBefore we even dive into the engagement framework for our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô, we need to understand some basic terms üëáüèº\\\\nFrequency of usage - Number of times someones orders from Zepto\\\\nDepth - No of items ordered in each category (Tomato, Onion, Potato under the vegetables section)\\\\nBreadth - No of categories ordered (1 Vegetable, 2 fruits, 1 Bread, 1 oil etc..)\\\\nThese are the 3 pillars of good engagement.\\\\nBased on these pillars we can define users into 3 buckets üëáüèº\\\\nCasual - People who order from Zepto once a week - once every two weeks\\\\nCore - People who order from Zepto two to three times a week\\\\nPower - People who order from Zepto 4+ times a week\\\\nWe are yet again going to pull excerpts from Aadeesh Deshpande‚Äôs (GX12) assignment on Zepto to deep dive into our framework.\\\\nThere are three types of buying habits for Zepto‚Äôs users üëáüèº\\\\nStock Up - Plan & buy groceries for the entire week\\\\nTop Up - Buying items that generally have a low shelf life (Vegetables, fruits, bread, milk etc.)\\\\nUnplanned Purchases - Items that might have run out without knowledge or items that have a sudden need (Oil, masala powders, Alcohol, Snacks etc..)\\\\nHere are some facts we know about our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô from the table we‚Äôve added above\\\\nCharacteristics\\\\nPotential ICP 1\\\\nName\\\\nYoung Guns\\\\nAge\\\\n21 - 26\\\\nIncome\\\\n8 lakhs/ annum+\\\\nRelationship Status\\\\n‚Üí Unmarried\\\\n‚Üí Sometimes in a relationship\\\\nEmployment Status/ Work Experience\\\\n‚Üí Freshly Employed\\\\nCity\\\\nTier 1\\\\nTech Savvy\\\\nYES\\\\nFrequently Used Social Media Apps\\\\nLinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram\\\\nEntertainment Services Used\\\\nDisney+ Hostar, Zee5, Amazon Prime\\\\nEcommerce services used\\\\nBookMyShow, Amazon, Myntra, Nykaa, Swiggy, Zomato, Zepto, Urban Company\\\\nIncome Spent On\\\\n1.

In his research, Aadeesh has quoted a research paper from Redseer which indicates that 70% of all grocery purchases are a mix of unplanned & top-up puchases.\\\\nSo what‚Äôs the engagement campaign for ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nTitle\\\\nContent\\\\nUnderstanding\\\\nWe know that a ton of Young Guns order from Zepto 2 - 3 times a week.

Desserts (if it‚Äôs dinner)\\\\nWhat does Retention look like for ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nFor Zepto, the best retention happens with both depth (more items in one category) and breadth (ordering from multiple categories). Once they start ordering different items, Zepto becomes the go to place for our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô.\\\\nIncreasing Depth and Breadth makes Zepto their Go-To product which naturally increases their frequency of usage.\\\\nWhich channels drive the best retention for ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nTimely Push Notifications:\\\\nPush Notifications that are backed up data is a great option. Let‚Äôs say one person orders a packet of milk every two days at exactly 9 PM. If they haven‚Äôt ordered milk for the last two days, a push notification asking them to order milk can go out ‚úåüèº\\\\nWhatsApp Notifications:\\\\nWhatsApp notifications can also be triggered as reminders for them.\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume that their favourite milkshake brand was out of stock in their last order. We can run a WhatsApp notification to tell them it‚Äôs back in stock\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume the milk example. We can push a WhatsApp notification to remind them\\\\nSlack or Teams Notifications\\\\nThis is a bit contradictory. But we know that ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô are heavily career focused. So there‚Äôs a very high chance that they may be using an internal communication tool like Slack or Microsoft Teams.\\\\nA quick growth test can be to connect their Slack IDs and send them reminders through them. Although be wary as this is just an hypothesis and hasn‚Äôt been proven by any grocery delivery startup yet!\\\\nWhich Products/ Categories drive the best retention?\\\\nQuick Perishable Items like Milk, Eggs, Bread, Fruits & Vegetables (High freq & high margin)\\\\nFlour, Oil, Rice items\\\\nBathroom & home cleaning equipments\\\\nBath, Body & Hygiene products\\\\nIndulgence items like Biscuits, Chips, Cold drinks, Ice cream etc..\\\\nFinally, why would ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô churn?\\\\nChurn can be divided into two types at the very basic level - Voluntary & Involuntary. Once you understand the reasons someone might churn, your team can work on preventing them. An acute understanding of the reasons can also help you fix issues in your marketing & brand perception\\\\nVoluntary Reasons For Churn\\\\nDelivery Time is too long\\\\nWrong Items were delivered\\\\nItems were delivered to the wrong address\\\\nProducts were damaged during delivery\\\\nExpired products were delivered\\\\nHigh delivery fee\\\\nProducts were out of stock\\\\nInvoluntary Reasons For Churn\\\\nShifted to a new location where Zepto is not available\\\\nOut of town for sometime\\\\nIssue with certain payment portals\\\\nAs you start mapping out all the potential reasons someone might churn, you can trace it back to early signs of churn. For example, if delivery time for a certain user has increased and you see a drop in their frequency, there might be some level of causation at play.\\\\nNegative actions to keep an eye on\\\\nDrop in App Open Rate\\\\nA lot of customer support tickets\\\\nDrop in the frequency of orders\\\\nDrop in basket value\\\\nDrop in weekly/ monthly AOV\\\\nIncrease in Cart Abandonment\\\\nA key concept you should keep in mind. There is a very good difference between causation and correlation.\\\\nIf order frequency is going down while delivery time increases, there is a high chance of relation between the two. But there is also a good chance that there‚Äôs no relation between the two.\\\\nMaybe they had a roommate who just moved out. Hence their order frequency is low\\\\nMaybe they started buying their fruits and vegetables from a street vendor because that was easy\\\\nAs a growth person, before you jump into any conclusions, you need to do the due diligence to understand the reason. You can do this by\\\\nSending a survey,\\\\nLooking at their support tickets\\\\nLooking at the change in items orders before & after change of freq\\\\nScheduling a 1:1 calls with your users\\\\n& more..\\\\nAs a growth person, your goal should be to seek the truth before you confirm your hypotheses.\\\\nWhat are some retention campaigns we can run for our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nThis is an example we‚Äôve pulled out from Aadeesh Deshpande‚Äôs assignment on Zepto. We‚Äôre just tweaking a bunch of the ideas for better presentation.\\\\nConcept\\\\nCampaign Details\\\\nTarget Segment\\\\nCore & Power Users\\\\nTarget ICP\\\\nYoung Guns\\\\nPurchase Behaviour For Core Users\\\\n‚Üí Top Ups and last minute unplanned purchases\\\\n‚Üí Mostly fruits, vegetables, groceries & household items\\\\n‚Üí 5+ products in cart\\\\n‚Üí 3 times a week minimum\\\\nPurchase Behaviour For Power Users\\\\n‚Üí All Categories\\\\n‚Üí 2 to 10 products in cart\\\\n‚Üí 5+ times a week minimum\\\\nGoal\\\\nResurrect Core & Power Users\\\\nCampaign Targeting\\\\nFrequency of orders has reduced.\\\\nReason: Increase in Delivery Time\\\\nProposed Solution\\\\nApologise for the delayed delivery time and compensate with Zepto coins!\\\\nPitch/ Content\\\\nPush Notification on app/ WhatsApp Notification\\\\nWe understand that your time is money.\\\\n3 out of your last 5 deliveries were delayed by more than 15 minutes. Please do accept our apologies in the form on 150 Zepto coins!\\\\nFrequency & Timing of Campaign\\\\nThe notification should be sent one week after the last order. A reminder needs to be sent 15 days after if the user is still not resurrected!\\\\nSuccess Metrics\\\\n‚Üí % of users displaying old purchase frequency after 8 weeks\\\\n‚Üí WOW Retention curve\\\\nOther Micro Metrics To Track\\\\n‚Üí App Notification to Click Ratio\\\\n‚Üí Click to ‚ÄòAdd to cart‚Äô ratio\\\\nReasons this campaign will work\\\\n‚Üí By accepting the honest mistake and offering a reward, the core & power users will be happy to come back\\\\n‚Üí The Zepto coins will further incentivise them to give another chance to Zepto!\\\\nAssociated Risks\\\\n‚Üí If the order is delayed again, user may lose trust in the brand & may never come back again\\\\n‚Üí They may be further offended that we are trying to bring them back with cash incentives\\\\nYou can use the same framework to create multiple resurrection campaigns for all types of users. This level of depth will help you prioritise segments in a massive product like Zepto.\\\\nThe same framework can be used for all other voluntary and involuntary churn. As a growth person, your first priority is to understand the reasons and prioritise the solutions on the cohorts which will have the maximum impact.\\\\n6. Onboarding\\\\nSince we‚Äôve prioritised acquisition and engagement & Retention, we‚Äôre not going to focus on the other two levers on this guide. The superpower every growth person must have is the ability to say ‚ÄòNO‚Äô and prioritise with laser focus.\\\\nEven if you have infinite resources to handle, you need to have focus. Focus will help you solve the most important problems effectively. Moreover focus will help you reach your revenue goals effectively!\\\\nBut if you were to work on the Onboarding lever, here are some metrics you could track\\\\nDownload Metrics\\\\nAdd to basket metrics\\\\nCheckout metrics\\\\n‚Üí Channel wise download metrics:\\\\nAds to Downloads\\\\nFacebook ads to app download\\\\nIG Ads to app download\\\\nOrganic to download\\\\nGoogle search to download\\\\nGoogle play store search to download\\\\nApp store search to download\\\\n‚Üí Add to basket metrics:\\\\nNumber of download to registration\\\\nNumber of registrations to ‚ÄòVisited Homepage‚Äô\\\\nNumber of ‚ÄòVisited Homepage‚Äô to ‚ÄòAdd Items to cart‚Äô\\\\nNumber of ‚ÄòAdd Items to cart‚Äô to ‚ÄòVisited Checkout Page‚Äô\\\\n‚Üí Checkout Metrics:\\\\nNumber of items added to cart\\\\nNumber of categories added to cart\\\\nAverage order value\\\\nNumber of users checked out out with COD\\\\nNumber of users checked out with Credit Cards\\\\nNumber of users checked out with UPI\\\\n‚Üí All these metrics can also be further divided into\\\\nDevice\\\\nPlatform\\\\nAcquisition channel\\\\nDark Store\\\\nGeographical Location\\\\nTime\\\\netc‚Ä¶\\\\nThis is a very broad list of metrics you can track to understand your users. As always the metrics you choose will be dependant on your current revenue goals and business priorities.\\\\n7. Monetisation\\\\nFinally, the most important, yet looked upon growth lever is the monetisation lever. Revenue should never be an afterthought for any business. Since this lever is also not a priority at the moment, we are not going to deep dive into it.\\\\nEven before you work on your monetisation lever, you have to run the ‚ÄòLitmus Test‚Äô to understand your retention. Monetisation only works if atleast a certain subset of your users retain after a certain period of time.\\\\nOnce the litmus test is cleared, the monetisation lever has four categories\\\\nWho to charge?\\\\nWhen to charge?\\\\nWhat to charge?\\\\nHow much to charge?\\\\nand that‚Äôs all about the Growth levers for Zepto.\\\\nüí°\\\\nBy the way, the depth you see here is just a feeler of the depth we teach at GrowthX üí´\\\\nGrowthX is an invite-only club of over 3000 members who are product, marketing, and business leaders, and founders from top internet-first companies like Google, Canva, CRED, Stripe, Netflix, and more üíé\\\\nWe teach our members how to scale revenues via frameworks that can be applied starting next Monday morning.

Why is Zepto well positioned to win?\\\\nZepto has grown at breakneck speeds and we truly believe that can win in the long term. Here are some reasons why\\\\n1. Huge market that‚Äôs growing exponentially:\\\\nThe Indian economy is growing at an exponential pace. What happened in the west 20 years back is happening in India currently. As more capital is being poured into the country, new businesses are being formed every day. This leads to a surplus of capital in the economy.\\\\nCapital that can be used to deploy to make you life easier, like buy groceries from Zepto, instead of going to a shop nearby.\\\\nThe picture below shows an estimate of how the Indian economy will grow in the next 25 years.\\\\nThis is the macro shift that BigBasket definitely missed in its formative years.\\\\n2. Customer trust with internet products is growing exponentially:\\\\nThe Indian consumer segment are slowly starting to understand and trust internet products. Before Ola, Flipkart, Myntra and other startups came into play, spending money on the internet was a challenge. And it was not because of the lack of money\\\\nPeople still had disposable income, but the trust levels were quite low. No one were accustomed to spending money on these consumer apps.\\\\nThe advent of internet apps, paired with JIO and UPI changed this game.\\\\nSpending money on the internet became an everyday thing and this naturally improved the trust levels of consumers. Zepto is well positioned at a time where consumer trust on these internet startups is growing exponentially.\\\\n3. Backed by an experienced leadership team:\\\\nThere‚Äôs a reason why Zepto went from zero to 2000+ employees in a matter of two years. Right from the get go, the founders were keen on hiring experienced leader for their management team.\\\\nThey hired folks who had already done that startup journey in the same or a related field. Some of their most senior hires were\\\\nTheir CFO, Jitendra N was already a VP of Finance at Pharmeasy\\\\nTheir CBO, Viral Jhaveri had worked leadership roles in Uber Eats and FreighTigers\\\\nTheir People function is headed by Roma Bindroo handled the people function at Johnson & Johnson for multiple years\\\\nThe founders understood that Zepto is still an operations heavy business with some software at the front. Even if they make the software 100x better, the operations cannot be avoided.\\\\nThey understood the game and started hiring folks who understood operations heavy businesses in the first place. This allowed them to reduce mistakes and scale faster than ever!\\\\nüöÄ\\\\nIf you‚Äôre a leader or a founder, keen to hire the Top 1% Growth Talent in India, do register to our waiting list here. We have helped 100+ top startups like CRED, PayTm, Swiggy & Dunzo hire their Growth talent.\\\\nPlease do fill out the form and one of our Talent Team superstars will reach back to you üí™üèº\\\\n4. Changing customer behaviour:\\\\nWith the boom of the economy, customer behaviour is also changing constantly. More customers are now starting to value Convenience >> Money.\\\\nStartups like Swiggy, Uber, Urban Company are a true testament to this!\\\\n5. High driver retention rate:\\\\nZepto has a 7% higher delivery driver retention rate than all hyperlocal delivery startups in India. This is because of a couple of reasons\\\\nZero long distance deliveries - Drivers hate nothing more than long distance deliveries\\\\nA centralised hub for all drivers - Since Zepto operates only out of dark stores, this gives them a chance to provide a designated waiting area for delivery partners. The founder mentioned that they also provide their partners with water, snacks & otehr condiments to make their life easier.\\\\nWhile 7% maybe a marginal amount, it can eventually add up. Driver experience is a key piece in winning this hyperlocal war. Since there is no penalty or drivers when they jump ships, the player who retains the most, eventually wins in the long term.\\\\n6. High NPS:\\\\nZepto was founded on the core insight of high NPS from the days of Kiranakart (their old startup). Basically customers who received their orders in less than 15 minutes had a higher NPS compared to customers who got it later.\\\\nSince Zepto is built on this core insight, their NPS is close to 80% (which is spectacular)\\\\n7. High Customer Retention rate:\\\\nYet again, during the days of Kiranakart, the founders realised that customers who recieved orders in less than 15 minutes retained better. The 15 min delivery is a WOW factor, around which Zepto is entirely built out of.\\\\nThis helps them own a retention rate of 60% even with 2 million+ customers & growing!\\\\n8. Wave 2 startups FTW:\\\\nWave 1 startups are the BigBaskets and Flipkarts of India. They faced a lot of challenges in terms of the MACRO\\\\nTalent\\\\nEconomical Growth\\\\nConsumer Trust\\\\nPayments\\\\nConsumer Sentiment etc\\\\nIn the last 10 years however, the entire Macro of India has shifted in favour of startups üëáüèº\\\\nThe talent pool has become denser (lots of people who have been there and done that)\\\\nThe economy has grown and is growing by leaps and bounds\\\\nThe people have more trust on Internet startups\\\\nPaying for something has become incredibly easier (thanks to UPI and all the Fintech startups)\\\\nConsumer have started spending more money rather than just saving it\\\\n9. They have solved for delivery accuracy:\\\\nA big challenge with old age grocery delivery startups is order accuracy. Issues like missing some items or even delivering the wrong items is terrible customer experience. The customer on the other end orders grocieries for convenience. Missed or wrong deliveries is probably the most inconvenient thing for them.\\\\nThe founding team developed Zepto with a razer focus of delivering the right order on time. The pay close attention to the dispatch process and fill any leaks to prevent wrong deliveries.\\\\nOther incumbents like Swiggy Instamart, BigBasket have also fixed this in the recent days. Should be interesting to see how they fare against Zepto in the future.\\\\n10. Expanding to new locations:\\\\nZepto‚Äôs founder mentioned in an interview is doubling in business every three months. This is possible because of their rapid expansion to new locations with a ton of darkstores. Since their inception, Zepto has grown from one store in Mumbai to 75+ locations across Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata and other tier 1 metro cities.\\\\nThis has been possible because of an experienced management team and high focus on creating formalised processes for everything!\\\\n11. Expanding to different categories:\\\\nZepto started with just groceries, but now they‚Äôve expanded to beauty accessories, baby products and even electronics. As they slowly figure out the supply chain and formulate the entire process, they can add more categories to this. An example could be umbrellas & raincoats during monsoon.\\\\nThe sky is the limit when they have the supply chain figured out for everything.\\\\n12. Execution On Point:\\\\nGrocery delivery is not a huge innovation. BigBasket and many other incumbents have already done it and grown massively. Even the 15 min delivery can be figured out by other players in a matter of time.\\\\nThe biggest strength of team Zepto is their ability to execute. Momentum is a very sneaky element that exponentially increases your success.\\\\nWhile other players are changing their business model to fit the 10 min delivery, Zepto is already acing it. The first mover advantage alone will carry them far above the finish line. By providing an incredible service, they can retain to all their customers while other incumbents are still building for the market.\\\\n5. What are the reasons Zepto might also lose in the hyper competitive grocery space?\\\\nThere are always two sides to any coin. If there are a couple of reasons why Zepto will win, there are even more reasons as to why it might lose. We wouldn‚Äôt do justice to this guide without looking at those points too!\\\\n1. Expanding to Tier 2 cities will be a challenge:\\\\nTier 1 cities currently contribute to almost the entire revenue of Zepto. Last time we checked, there were no Zepto owned darkstores in tier 2+ cities. Zepto will reach a plateau as they expand across all tier 1 cities.\\\\nThey can only unlock even more growth when they reach tier 2 cities. However tier 2+ cities are built different in terms of\\\\nPopulation distribution\\\\nMindset\\\\nCustomer sentiment\\\\nBuilding Zepto for tier 2+ cities will require a whole different mindset that the current model. They will have to rethink everything which will require time & a lot of money.\\\\n2. Not all dark stores will be profitable:\\\\nThe cold truth is that not all darkstores will be profitable. Power laws can be crazy in business and a small percentage of the dark stores may end up generating the most amount of revenue.\\\\nThe hard part about this is each darkstore, irrespective of revenue will have a fixed operating cost. This will be split between\\\\nSalaries\\\\nRent\\\\nOther bills\\\\nSo at some point Zepto will have to decide between closing low revenue locations or keeping them alive for just overall brand visibility.\\\\n3. White-labelling products is an operational challenge:\\\\nThere is only so much you can earn from selling other brands. That‚Äôs exactly why so many supermarkets end up creating their own products like rice, oil, bread etc..\\\\nIt allows them to control the supply chain and take a bigger share of the revenue pie.\\\\nHowever producing your own products is also investment heavy. While production is the first challenge, Quality Control & Branding is an even bigger challenge. Acquisitions can come in handy for this play.\\\\nWe‚Äôll just have to wait and see how Zepto play this card out!\\\\n4. Free Delivery might hit on the margins:\\\\nWhile ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô is great for the growth stage, it is not sustainable for overall sustenance. At some point, Zepto will have to cut down on ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô. Or they might also need to increase the minimum threshold for ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô.\\\\nThis might lead to a drop in order frequency and users jumping to competitor products who do offer ‚Äò Free Delivery‚Äô.\\\\n5. Zero Cost Of Switching:\\\\nThe biggest problem with hyperlocal startups like this is the switching cost. Or should we say that there isn‚Äôt say.\\\\nWhat is a switching cost?\\\\nIt is the cost a customer has to pay when they decide to use another application. For example, when someone decided to use another SaaS app, the switching cost is loss of data. If they decide to play another game, they will end up losing all their progress and having to start from scratch.\\\\nEssentially, switching cost is a hidden cost that prevents a customer from using another app.\\\\nSince there is ‚ÄòZero Switching Costs‚Äô customer can have all of their competeitors on the phone and order from anyone of required. If they get one or two bad experiences, they might immediately jump to a competeitor.\\\\nIf BigBasket can also consistently deliver in under 15 minutes, Zepto is no longer a ‚Äòmust-have‚Äô but a ‚ÄòGood to have‚Äô.\\\\n6. 10 min model is replicable:\\\\nOne big IP risk is that their min model is incredible 10 in delivery can be implemented by anyone. All they need is some capital to frontload their darkstore and they‚Äôre good to go. To Retain customers in the long run, Zepto will have to keep providing on their promise of quick delivery.\\\\n7. Change in government regulations:\\\\nA lot of things need to go right for internet startups to succeed in India. Once such thing are the government regulations. As of now, Zepto can classify their drivers as partners and not employees. This allows them to pay their drivers like a consultant rather than an employee.\\\\nThis also includes all drivers who operate with Swiggy, Zomato and other delivery partners.\\\\nIf one day, the government mandates that they should also be treated as employees, it will mess with their entire P&L and might even sink the business.\\\\n8. Lose out on the waiting game\\\\nThe team behind is executing well, but can they maintain it for the long term. Old players like BigBasket are flush with an instream of capital from the TATA group. While Zepto is dependant on investor money to stay afloat. Sure, most of their darkstores eventually ramp up and start earning revenue.\\\\nBut what if players like BigBasket decide to cut Zepto on delivery costs & margins?\\\\nThis will be a long game where Zepto can only win if they are fiscally discipline and provide a stellar experience.\\\\nThese are some of the reasons we think Zepto might fail in the next 2 - 5 years.\\\\nHowever no one can predict the future and these are all just speculations up to this point. But as a growth and business person, it is your job to constantly speculate, hypothesise and play the devil‚Äôs advocate to future proof your business.\\\\nWe hope you enjoyed reading this blog.\\\\nüöÄ\\\\nIf you have any feedback, please do leave them in the TypeForm here.

The owners of Zepto, Aadit Palicha, and Kaivalya Vohra launched Zepto to provide customers with ultra-fast grocery delivery.\\\\nSpecializing in delivering groceries before the turn of a year is what Zepto is hailed for. It has worked with 86+ dark store owners in 13 different areas in 2021, generating over one million deliveries. To fulfill orders promptly, Zepto employs its network of \\\\\\'cloud shops\\\\\\' or micro-warehouses.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s secret of the trade lies in its capacity to routinely offer an extensive range of goods for delivery in under ten minutes. It\\\\\\'s at the heart of everything the company does, and it\\\\\\'s why they\\\\\\'ve been able to grow so quickly while maintaining incredible client loyalty.\\\\nZepto operates in multiple cities with a 1000+ strong workforce and delivers 25000+ products, including fresh produce, daily essentials, health products, and more, within 10 minutes.

Looking ahead, the market is anticipated to experience substantial growth and is projected to reach $37.0 billion by 2028. This growth trajectory indicates a remarkable compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31.3% during the period from 2023 to 2028.\\\\nThe sector has expanded in prevalence in the past few years as a result of evolving customer habits, growing urbanization, and a tech-savvy generation that prefers to make online purchases.\\\\nAs per RedSeer, India\\\\\\'s quick commerce market is set for impressive growth, projected to expand by 10‚Äì15 times by 2025 and reach a market size of nearly $5.5 billion. This substantial growth is expected to surpass other markets, including China, in terms of quick commerce adoption.\\\\nAs their standard of living increases and their daily schedules get tighter, consumers are flocking to customized and convenient internet platforms for grocery shopping instead of walking down to the local shops.\\\\nFollowing the COVID-19 pandemic, the popularity of online grocery delivery became increasingly evident. As a consequence of social distancing constraints, consumers are converting to online grocery shopping, which is not only convenient but also safer.\\\\nZepto - Founders and Team\\\\nAadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, both 19-year-old childhood pals, founded Zepto after walking out of Stanford University\\\\\\'s renowned computer science department to return to their home country, India, and start up a business. The Zepto company began its operations in April 2021.\\\\nKaivalya Vohra\\\\nKaivalya Vohra is the CTO and Co-Founder of Zepto. He was also the founder and CTO of KiranaKart. He also attended Stanford University to pursue a degree in Computer Science, but like Aadit, he decided to leave the university. Kaivalya, along with Aadit, participated in Y Combinator as well.\\\\nAadit Palicha\\\\nAadit Palicha is the CEO and Co-Founder of Zepto. He was also the founder and CEO of KiranaKart. After completing an IB diploma from GEMS Education in Mathematics and Computer Science, Palicha then went for a Bachelor\\\\\\'s degree in Computer Science from Stanford University, however, he quit the program in the middle to launch his firm. Aadit then completed Y Combinator Grade: W21 and started with PryvaSee as a Project Lead. Aadit Palicha then founded GoPool, his first startup, when he was just 17. He left the same in April 2020 and founded KiranaKart and then Zepto.\\\\nFlaunt your startup with StartupTalky\\\\n800+ stories, thousands of founders, and millions of visitors.

Inviting founders and startups who are building sustainable solutions from ground zero! Startups who run the show, StartupTalky will let the world know!\\\\nZepto - Startup Story\\\\nMany of us have \"startup ideas,\" but even the most creative among us struggle to see them through. Palicha and Vohra had both enrolled at Stanford to earn a Computer Science degree but had dropped out to follow their business passions instead.\\\\nThe story of Zepto started during the COVID-19 outbreak. The concept for Zepto sprang from the limitations of their houses. A surge in demand for delivery services meant that groceries and other necessities would arrive in a couple of days, creating a void for quick delivery. As a result, Zepto was created with all this insight.\\\\nThese teenagers were abruptly detained, because of Covid norms, detained in their Mumbai homes after significant collaboration on many projects, including a ride-hailing commuting app for kids. Even while grocery delivery, which was deemed important by local authorities, was still permitted across much of the nation as the virus spread, the duo battled to get their provisions as the illness expanded.\\\\nWhile Zepto is the focus of attention, Palicha and Vohra\\\\\\'s first venture, KiranaKart, did not receive the same acclaim. Zepto, on the other hand, is inspired by KiranaKart. KiranaKart, as its name implies, was a supermarket delivery service. It had made arrangements with Kirana merchants to provide groceries in 45 minutes or less. A $730,000 pre-seed round was led by Global Founders Capital, 2 AM Ventures, Contrary Capital, and angel investors. At the time, Vohra and Palicha planned to make the first 1.5 lakh deliveries for INR 1.\\\\nZepto - Mission and Vision\\\\nAs two bachelors living alone, the founders found it most difficult to obtain food, therefore, they focused their applications on grocery delivery. So, whereas KiranaKart, their first startup, tried to make grocery delivery easier for Kiranas, Zepto aims to shorten delivery times.\\\\nZepto - Name, Logo, and Tagline\\\\nThe firm, which uses the term \"Zepto\" to denote \"a factor of 10‚Åª¬≤¬π, i.e. 0.000000000000000000001,\" named after a minuscule unit of time, offers a 10-minute grocery delivery service, surpassing numerous well-funded competitors.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s tagline says, \"Groceries delivered in 10 minutes\".\\\\nZepto - Business and Revenue Model\\\\nZepto delivers groceries in ten minutes through a system of dark storefronts and mini-warehouses, on up to 90% of orders. Zepto works in the quick commerce segment of India. It is designed to be customer-centric and built around the instant service model.\\\\nTo ensure a flawless delivery experience, Aadit says that their average delivery time is 8 minutes and 47 seconds. Through a chain of dark stores or retail distribution centers, the Mumbai-based company employs a hotspot method to cater largely to digital purchases.\\\\nA dark store is a tiny neighborhood storehouse that customers cannot visit but purchase online to get packaged delivery. While dark stores are not new to the Indian industry, Aadit believes that the idea has yet to be completely explored. Population, traffic dynamics, topography, road patterns, weather conditions, last-mile operational improvement, real estate prices, and other geographic data and local intelligence aid Zepto in optimizing its connectivity. Furthermore, the startup\\\\\\'s dark warehouses and cool rooms are custom-designed to satisfy particular criteria such as ease of travel, allowing packers to move as swiftly as possible to fill orders.\\\\nLocation intelligence and geographic data, such as topography, population, road patterns, traffic dynamics, weather, last-mile supply availability, real estate values, and so on, are said to help Zepto optimize its network.\\\\nZepto - Funding and Investors\\\\nZepto, the Mumbai-based quick commerce unicorn, achieved unicorn status in August 2023 after raising $200 million in a Series E funding round, which brought its valuation to $1.4 billion. This milestone marked the end of India\\\\\\'s 11-month unicorn drought. The Series E round was led by The StepStone Group, with participation from Goodwater Capital and existing investors.\\\\nIn June 2024, Zepto raised $665 million, which valued the company at $3.6 billion. Just a few months later, on August 30, 2024, Zepto raised $340 million in Series G funding, which increased its valuation to $5 billion. The Series G round was led by General Catalyst, with Dragon Fund and Epiq Capital joining as new investors. Existing backers such as StepStone, Lightspeed, DST, and Contrary also increased their investments, reflecting strong confidence in Zepto\\\\\\'s growth potential.\\\\nIn November 2024, Zepto raised another $350 million from a group of domestic investors, led by Motilal Oswal\\\\\\'s private wealth division, at a flat valuation of $5 billion. This brings the total funding raised by Zepto to $2 billion.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s initial seed funding in September 2020 was led by Contrary.\\\\n| Date | Round | Amount | Lead Investors |\\\\n|---|---|---|---|\\\\n| November 21, 2024 | Series G | $350 | Motilal Oswal Wealth |\\\\n| August 30, 2024 | Series G | $340 million | General Catalyst, Mars Growth Capital |\\\\n| June 21, 2024 | Series F | $665 million | Glade Brook Capital Partners, Nexus Venture Partners, StepStone Group |\\\\n| Nov 8, 2023 | Series E | $31.3 million | Goodwater Capital, Nexus Venture Partners |\\\\n| Aug 25, 2023 | Series E | $200 million | StepStone Group |\\\\n| May 2, 2022 | Series D | $200 million | Y Combinator Continuity Fund |\\\\n| Dec 20, 2021 | Series C | $100 million | Y Combinator Continuity Fund |\\\\n| Oct 31, 2021 | Series B | $60 million | Glade Brook Capital Partners |\\\\n| Mar 22, 2021 | Series A | $6.5 million | Nexus Venture Partners |\\\\n| Sep 1, 2020 | Pre Seed Round | - | Contrary |\\\\nZepto - Shareholding\\\\nZepto shareholding pattern as of October 2024 (source: Tracxn):\\\\n| Zepto Shareholders | Percentage |\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n| Aadit Palicha | 0.9% |\\\\n| Kaivalya Vohra | 0.7% |\\\\n| Nexus Venture Partners | 18.6% |\\\\n| Glade Brook Capital | 10.3% |\\\\n| StepStone Group | 9.8% |\\\\n| Y Combinator | 8.7% |\\\\n| LGF Scale I | 7.8% |\\\\n| Rocket Internet | 3.0% |\\\\n| General Catalyst | 4.1% |\\\\n| Goodwater Capital | 1.8% |\\\\n| Razor\\\\\\'s Edge Ventures | 1.6% |\\\\n| Contrary | 1.6% |\\\\n| Kaiser Permanente | 2.3% |\\\\n| avra | 1.3% |\\\\n| SpringBlue Capital | 1.0% |\\\\n| Lightspeed Venture Partners | 0.8% |\\\\n| Global Founders Capital | 0.8% |\\\\n| Crimson | 0.5% |\\\\n| Vanderbilt University | 0.3% |\\\\n| Mangum | 0.3% |\\\\n| Bayhouse Capital | 0.2% |\\\\n| Mehta Ventures | <0.1% |\\\\n| Contrary Capital | <0.1% |\\\\n| Zpt Holdings | 2.1% |\\\\n| AZ04 | 1.4% |\\\\n| Kiranakart SPV | 0.6% |\\\\n| Sayacorps | 0.4% |\\\\n| C Opportunities | 0.1% |\\\\n| Jung Lish Lee | 2.3% |\\\\n| Oliver Jung | 0.7% |\\\\n| Oleg Wladimir Nicolas Tscheltzoff | 0.2% |\\\\n| Aditi Javesh Jhaveri | <0.1% |\\\\n| Manoj Chawla | <0.1% |\\\\n| Kavit Dilip Palicha | 8.0% |\\\\n| Jaideep Vohra | 6.7% |\\\\n| Other Investors | 1.0% |\\\\nAmong the shareholders, Nexus Venture Partners holds the largest stake, holding 18.6% of Zepto. Other prominent owners of Zepto include Y Combinator, Glade Brook Capital, StepStone Group, and co-founders Aadit Palicha (along with Kavit Dilip Palicha) and Kaivalya Vohra (along with Jaideep Vohra), among others.\\\\nZepto - IPO\\\\nZepto plans to go public in 2025. To prepare for its IPO, the company set up a new entity, Zepto Marketplace Private Limited, in October 2024 to simplify its operations. Zepto currently operates under a B2B model, sourcing products directly from brands and selling them to its partner companies, which then distribute the products to customers under a licensing agreement.\\\\nIn January 2025, Zepto completed its domicile shift from Singapore to India ahead of its IPO, which is now expected to raise between $800 million and $1 billion, including secondaries. Initially, the company targeted a $450 million primary capital raise.\\\\nZepto has hired Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Axis Capital as advisors for the IPO. This marks a key step in its journey as a leader in the quick commerce industry.\\\\nZepto - Growth and Revenue\\\\nZepto has seen impressive growth, serving 10 major cities with 1,000+ employees. They deliver more than 5,000 products, revolutionizing the Indian grocery segment with 10-minute delivery, advanced tech, and optimized centers.\\\\nEngineering, operations, marketing, and financial positions are also available at Zepto. Palicha claims that month-over-month growth is 200%, with a monthly retention rate of 78%.\\\\n‚ÄúWe are looking at a pretty crazy runrate,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn the past one and a half months, we have grown our business by 10 times. And now we are working to grow another 10 times by February or March,‚Äù said Palicha in December 2021.\\\\nZepto, when it was a five-month-old startup, had secured a valuation of $570 million after raising $100 million in a Series C round headed by Y Combinator\\\\\\'s Continuity Fund, which was a 2X increase from its previous valuation of $60 million only 45 days before that. Zepto raised another round led by Y Combinator to lift its valuation further to $900 million, so there is certainly impressive growth that the company has received in funding as well.\\\\nAnother positive development for Zepto has been the expertise it has been able to acquire. Plenty of well-known senior executives from Uber, Flipkart, Dream11, Amazon, and Pharmeasy have joined the team.\\\\nAccording to Palicha, one of the reasons why several entrepreneurs have chosen Zepto is that it has enabled individuals who had transferred from Mumbai to Bangalore to come back to their homes. He says, nevertheless, that the startup\\\\\\'s rapid development, rigorous execution, and ambitions have captivated others who share his interests. \"We\\\\\\'ve been able to walk the walk,\" he said.\\\\n‚ÄúThey originally launched with a different model, swiftly pivoted to quick commerce in August 2021 and are now adding 100,000 new customers every week, 60% of them women. Their attention to detail on the logistics experience is unparalleled and this has enabled them to scale to most major metros in just 5 months. Simply put, we‚Äôre confident Zepto will win in this space over the long-term,\" said Anu Hariharan, a partner at Y Combinator, in a statement.\\\\nZepto has demonstrated significant growth in recent times, with the majority of its dark stores now operating profitably. According to co-founder and CEO Aadit Palicha, Zepto has successfully established its presence in major metro cities in India with over 300-400 dark stores. Impressively, approximately 50‚Äì60 percent of these dark stores have started generating cash flows, indicating the effectiveness of Zepto\\\\\\'s business model and operational strategies. This noteworthy achievement highlights Zepto\\\\\\'s commitment to sustainable growth and profitability in the fiercely competitive quick-commerce industry.\\\\nZepto Financials\\\\n| Zepto Financials | FY22 | FY23 | FY24 |\\\\n|---|---|---|---|\\\\n| Operating Revenue | INR 142.3 crore | INR 2,026 crore | INR 4,454 crore |\\\\n| Expenses | INR 532.7 crore | INR 3,350 crore | INR 5,754 crore |\\\\n| Profit/Loss | INR 390.3 crore (loss) | INR 1,272 crore (loss) | INR 1,248 crore (loss) |\\\\nIn FY23, the quick-commerce startup‚Äôs operating revenue stood at INR 2,026 crore.

The company also reported a 140% year-on-year growth, with 75% of its dark stores achieving full EBITDA positivity by May 2024.\\\\nZepto - Challenges\\\\nZepto has encountered some challenges lately, and in one of the recent ones, there were instances of founder and investor impropriety within the quick commerce delivery startup. Ansh Nanda, an alleged co-founder of the startup said that he was forced to relinquish his stakes in the startup by the other cofounders and by Nexus Ventures. This was carried forward by Nanda, who lodged an FIR against the cofounders of Zepto and the Nexus Ventures partner, Suvir Sujan. However, the co-founders responded to the same without much delay by approaching the Delhi High Court. Zepto is the third startup that is backed by Nexus and where one of the co-founders has been named in an FIR. YoloBus and Acko were two other companies that dealt with the same before.\\\\nZepto - Advertisements and Social Media Campaigns\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s marketing strategy has been a key driver of its rapid growth in the quick-commerce industry. The creative brilliance of L&K Saatchi & Saatchi was evident in three earlier ads promoting Zepto\\\\\\'s products and services.\\\\nBuilding on this success, Zepto continued to impress with new campaigns featuring celebrated singers like Kailash Kher, Shankar Mahadevan, and Usha Uthup during the IPL season of 2022. These unique and melodic campaigns resonated with audiences, boosting Zepto\\\\\\'s visibility and brand appeal.\\\\nFurthermore, the launch of the \"Nahi Milega\" campaign in March 2023, featuring the character \"Uncle Ji,\" highlighted unlimited free deliveries, solidifying Zepto\\\\\\'s position as the go-to platform for ultra-fast and cost-effective grocery delivery. With an innovative approach and successful marketing initiatives, Zepto has emerged as a leading player in the competitive quick-commerce industry, catering to the needs of time-conscious consumers.\\\\nZepto - Competitors\\\\nMany businesses compete with Zepto and have already been driving fast-paced delivery of groceries like:\\\\n- Swiggy Instamart\\\\n- Blinkit\\\\n- Big Basket\\\\nDunzo is another startup, that uses its Xpress Mart dark shop network to deliver groceries in Bengaluru in 19 minutes and competes with Zepto.\\\\nZepto - Future Plans\\\\nZepto currently operates in major cities across India, including Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Ghaziabad, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, and Kolkata. The company has ambitious plans to multiply its dark stores and expand its delivery network with profitability in focus.\\\\nZepto has sped up its store expansion, increasing its target from 700 to 1,200 stores by March 2025. With over 650 outlets in operation as of January 2025, the company is strengthening its presence in the quick commerce space.\\\\nA new key driver of Zepto‚Äôs growth is its food and beverage division, Zepto Caf√©, which is currently in 15% of its dark stores. With an estimated ARR of INR 160 crore, Zepto Caf√© is expanding rapidly, adding over 100 outlets monthly and targeting an INR 1,000 crore revenue run rate by FY26.\\\\nThe company is projecting gross sales of $5.5 billion in the final quarter of FY26, with an aim to achieve positive EBITDA (excluding ESOPs).\\\\nThe ultimate goal is to become a publicly listed company.

The company has rapidly scaled up to become one of the most recognized names in the ultra-fast grocery delivery segment. In this article, we‚Äôll take a deep dive into Zepto‚Äôs business model, revenue streams, and the strategies that fuel its success.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs Business Model Overview\\\\nZepto operates on a quick-commerce (q-commerce) model, which focuses on delivering groceries and daily essentials to customers in ultra-short time frames. Unlike traditional grocery e-commerce players, Zepto‚Äôs unique selling point lies in its 10-minute delivery promise. Here‚Äôs how its model is structured:\\\\na. Dark Stores\\\\n- Zepto operates a network of dark stores, which are small warehouses strategically located in densely populated urban areas.\\\\n- These dark stores are optimized for speed, with AI and machine learning used to ensure efficient inventory management, storage, and order fulfillment.\\\\n- The proximity of these dark stores to customer locations enables the company to meet its delivery promises.\\\\nb. Hyperlocal Delivery\\\\n- Zepto uses a hyperlocal delivery model, which involves sourcing products from dark stores closest to the customer.\\\\n- Its algorithm-based delivery system ensures optimal route planning and efficient utilization of delivery personnel.\\\\nc. App-Based Ordering\\\\n- The Zepto app is designed for simplicity, allowing users to quickly browse, select, and order from a wide range of groceries and essentials.\\\\n- The app also personalizes the shopping experience by leveraging customer data to recommend frequently purchased items.\\\\nZepto Key Revenue Streams\\\\nDespite offering free or low-cost delivery to customers, Zepto has built a strong revenue model. Here‚Äôs how the company earns money:\\\\na. Product Margins\\\\n- Zepto earns revenue through the sale of groceries and daily essentials. The company procures goods directly from manufacturers, wholesalers, and distributors at lower prices, allowing it to enjoy healthy margins on most products.\\\\n- Its dark store model ensures cost efficiency, as these warehouses are located in less expensive real estate areas compared to retail spaces.\\\\nb. Delivery Charges\\\\n- While Zepto offers free delivery for orders above a certain threshold, it charges a delivery fee for smaller orders. This fee helps cover operational and logistics costs.\\\\n- In addition, Zepto has experimented with subscription-based delivery models, offering unlimited free deliveries for a monthly or annual fee.\\\\nc. Advertising and Promotional Listings\\\\n- Zepto monetizes its platform by allowing brands to advertise and promote their products. This includes:\\\\n- Featured listings on the app.\\\\n- Banner advertisements for specific brands or products.\\\\n- These promotions help brands gain visibility and increase sales, while Zepto earns a commission for the space and exposure provided.\\\\nd. Private Label Products\\\\n- Zepto has introduced its private label brands, offering staples like rice, pulses, and cooking oil under its own label. These products yield higher profit margins compared to third-party goods and help build customer loyalty.\\\\ne. Data Monetization\\\\n- By collecting and analyzing customer data, Zepto generates valuable insights on buying patterns, preferences, and demand trends. While this isn‚Äôt a direct revenue stream currently, it offers long-term monetization opportunities through partnerships with FMCG brands and suppliers.\\\\nKey Features of Zepto‚Äôs Strategy\\\\nZepto‚Äôs success can be attributed to its strategic focus on operational efficiency and customer experience. Here are the core elements of its strategy:\\\\na. Technology-Driven Operations\\\\n- Zepto leverages advanced technology, including AI and machine learning, to optimize inventory, manage supply chains, and predict demand.\\\\n- The company‚Äôs algorithm ensures that products are stocked in the right quantities and locations, minimizing wastage and ensuring availability.\\\\nb. Strategic Location of Dark Stores\\\\n- Dark stores are located in high-demand areas, ensuring that they can cater to a radius of 1‚Äì3 kilometers. This proximity to customers is critical for meeting the 10-minute delivery promise.\\\\nc. Focus on Speed and Convenience\\\\n- Speed is the cornerstone of Zepto‚Äôs business model. Orders are processed immediately after being placed, and delivery riders are assigned based on proximity and route optimization.\\\\n- The app‚Äôs user-friendly interface adds to the convenience factor, ensuring repeat purchases.\\\\nd. Diverse Product Offering\\\\n- Zepto offers a wide range of products, from fresh produce and groceries to personal care items, snacks, and beverages. This variety ensures that it meets diverse customer needs.\\\\nZepto‚Äôs Financial Performance\\\\nZepto has demonstrated impressive growth in a short span of time. As of the latest updates:\\\\n- Revenue Growth: Zepto reported robust revenue growth, driven by an increase in repeat customers and higher order volumes.\\\\n- Burn Rate: Like many startups in the q-commerce space, Zepto operates at a high burn rate due to marketing, operations, and delivery costs. However, the company is focused on achieving profitability by optimizing operations and increasing average order values.\\\\nChallenges Faced by Zepto\\\\nDespite its rapid success, Zepto faces several challenges:\\\\n- High Competition: Players like Blinkit (Zomato-owned), Swiggy Instamart, and Dunzo are fierce competitors in the quick-commerce space, offering similar services.\\\\n- Logistics Costs: Maintaining a fleet of delivery personnel and managing dark store operations require significant investment.\\\\n- Customer Retention: As the novelty of 10-minute delivery wears off, retaining customers with value-added services and competitive pricing becomes crucial.\\\\n- Regulatory Scrutiny: The quick-commerce industry has faced criticism for putting undue pressure on delivery personnel, raising concerns about safety and labor practices.\\\\nFuture Prospects and Growth Strategies\\\\nZepto has ambitious plans for the future, including:\\\\n- Geographical Expansion: The company is expanding its footprint in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, tapping into the growing demand for convenience.\\\\n- New Product Categories: Zepto is exploring new categories like electronics and pharmacy to diversify its offerings.\\\\n- Sustainability Initiatives: The company is working on reducing packaging waste and introducing eco-friendly delivery practices.\\\\n- AI and Automation: Continued investment in technology will help Zepto improve operational efficiency and lower costs.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nZepto‚Äôs business model is a testament to the growing demand for quick commerce in urban India. By focusing on speed, technology, and customer convenience, the company has carved out a unique space in the competitive grocery delivery market.

This integrated approach demonstrates Zepto\\\\\\'s dedication to providing convenience and efficiency in the grocery delivery industry. Zepto\\\\\\'s business strategy revolves around offering ultra-fast delivery, with a focus on customer convenience and satisfaction.\\\\nPromotion\\\\nZepto employs a diverse marketing approach, utilizing digital channels like social media and influencer marketing, alongside out-of-home advertising for brand visibility. Positive media coverage enhances its reputation, while meme marketing fosters audience engagement. A referral program incentivizes customer loyalty, contributing to both acquisition and retention.

Its customers include young professionals, students, and families who need things fast. The service is for people who like using technology to save time. Zepto focuses on city areas, offering a simple online shopping experience.\\\\nZepto Marketing Strategy\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s marketing strategy has played a crucial role in growing its business to this extent. A lot of innovative steps have been taken by the company to support and boost its business growth. Zepto\\\\\\'s target audience is generally young adults and the modern generation. Here is the detailed overview you must read.\\\\n10-Mins Delivery Strategy\\\\nThe idea of online grocery delivery is not new. Startups like Dunzo and Blinkit are already providing these services. The fact that distinguishes Zepto from all its competitors is its 10-minute delivery of groceries and other products. You might have heard about Zomato Instant, which provides food delivery within 10 minutes, but Zepto is the first player in the grocery delivery segment to offer a 10-minute grocery delivery service.\\\\nThe idea of 10-minute grocery delivery is unique, but it was not that easy to implement. To fulfill its promise to deliver groceries in the specified time, Zepto introduced the concept of the dark store model. The dark store is like a fulfillment center for Zepto; it is not accessible to the public but is efficient enough to fulfill orders rapidly.\\\\nArtificial intelligence is used by Zepto to pick, pack, and transport orders in leaps and bounds. Whenever any customer places an order, a person with a tablet is assigned to pick up and pack the order within 60 seconds. It means that at the time you make the payment, someone is already preparing your order for dispatch. The company claims that 8 minutes and 40 seconds is the average delivery time they have achieved.\\\\nZepto operates its dark store delivery within a 3 km radius, and it doesn\\\\\\'t penalize its delivery boy for late delivery.\\\\nDiscounts are a way to attract customers, but as a new player in the segment, offering huge discounts was not a sustainable option for Zepto. Hence, the 10-minute delivery strategy comes out to be a panacea for Zepto.\\\\nAdvertising and Branding Strategy\\\\nThere is not only one thing responsible for the success of Zepto, but an incredible advertising strategy has also played an important role in the success. L&K Saatchi and Saatchi is an advertising agency that was assigned to advertise Zepto and build a strong brand image in front of consumers. The main theme of all the ads is to emphasize the 10-minute delivery of Zepto.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s ads are attention-grabbing ads that suddenly capture the focus, and this is what every brand wants. When a boy suddenly wakes up and runs toward the door, it creates a question in the minds of viewers about why he is running. The twist and excitement of the ad make it capable of grabbing the attention of viewers.\\\\nIf I try to summarize the above ad in a single sentence, then it is like this: From the time you wake up until the time you sleep, every essential product will get delivered to your doorstep within 10 minutes.\\\\nEach ad that was created is meant to make the consumer feel how Zepto is capable of changing their daily grocery shopping habit. Since advertising is the best way to market the product and build a strong brand image, Zepto has fully utilized the benefits of marketing.\\\\nAdvertising was not only done on social media channels, but it also planted its hoardings in the streets of cities in which Zepto\\\\\\'s services are operational.\\\\nSocial Media Meme Marketing\\\\nIn today\\\\\\'s generation of technology and innovation, we cannot ignore the power of social media. There is a huge chance you\\\\\\'ll find your target audience on the social media platform. Hence, every brand is focusing on social media marketing. Zepto is also not behind the race; it leverages the social platform to engage its audience through meme marketing.\\\\nFor the recently released movie \\\\\\'Avatar: The Way of Water,\\\\\\' Zepto created a meme to grab the consumer\\\\\\'s attention by following the ongoing trend. It\\\\\\'s just one example, but if you visit Zepto\\\\\\'s social media page, you\\\\\\'ll find plenty of such memes.\\\\nMeme marketing is a trend today because people often share memes with their loved ones. This will help the brand get some organic reach and, at the same time, promote the brand. Zepto knows the power of memes very well. That\\\\\\'s why if you open their page on any platform like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, you\\\\\\'ll find amazing memes.\\\\nTh has gained a lot of positive feedback from customers. Along with meme marketing, they sometimes collaborate with famous social media influencers to make videos for them. This tactic helps to create a loyal fanbase and also helps the brand image flourish.\\\\nMicro-Moments Marketing Strategy\\\\nMicro-moments are key moments in a customer\\\\\\'s journey where brands can influence buying decisions. Zepto understands this and focuses on sending the right messages at the right time to connect with customers. Studies show that over 150 billion mobile micro-moments happen every day, influencing more than 70% of purchases. Brands using this approach see a 74% success rate in increasing revenue.\\\\nCustomer Acquisition and Retention Strategy\\\\nPlayers in the quick commerce industry like Dunzo, Swiggy Instamart, and Blinkit are well-funded and established. These big giants have already acquired a huge market share in the segment by offering huge discounts and other offers. So it was not easy for Zepto to acquire customers and retain them.\\\\nDiscounts are not the only things that attract consumers. Consumers are always hungry for something new, and exactly here, Zepto played its game. Acquisition of customers and retaining customers are two different things. Other players in the segment have easily acquired customers but struggled to retain them.\\\\nCustomers are used to switching platforms and ordering items from the app, where the discount is heavy. In the case of Zepto, it has given discounts and at the same time provided high-speed free delivery. It helps to enhance Zepto\\\\\\'s retention rate significantly.\\\\nNo other players in the segment were making that fast delivery. This eventually leads to an increase in Zepto\\\\\\'s consumer base.\\\\nDigital Marketing\\\\nZepto uses digital marketing to reach busy customers with fast and targeted ads. They focus on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook to promote quick delivery and special offers. Zepto also uses precision messaging or micro-moments to engage customers when they are likely to make a purchase. Through online campaigns, Zepto builds brand awareness and encourages customers to use their service for fast grocery deliveries.\\\\nReferral Programs\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s referral program plays a crucial role in its successful marketing strategy. The program offers unique codes to its users for sharing, which incentivizes both existing and new users with rewards such as discounts. This helps in cost-effective customer acquisition and increases customer retention. The program\\\\\\'s seamless integration with social media, multiple reward options, and gamification elements make it a dynamic and impactful tool for Zepto\\\\\\'s growth and customer loyalty.\\\\nBeyond transactional benefits, Zepto\\\\\\'s referral initiative is a brand-building powerhouse, fostering advocacy and community engagement. By creating a positive customer experience and utilizing word-of-mouth influence, the program stands as a testament to the brand\\\\\\'s commitment to customer satisfaction and strategic marketing prowess.\\\\nPartnerships with Influencers\\\\nZepto partners with social media influencers who create authentic content to showcase its services. This helps Zepto build trust, connect with specific audiences, and reach more customers. This approach has fueled rapid growth, with the company raising over $300 million in just one year, emphasizing its focus on long-term customer relationships.\\\\nMarketing Campaign of Zepto\\\\nboAt, India‚Äôs leading audio brand, has teamed up with Zepto to bring high-quality audio products to your doorstep in just 10 minutes. This partnership combines boAt‚Äôs top-notch audio expertise with Zepto‚Äôs quick delivery, making it easier to enjoy music, movies, podcasts, and more. Whether it\\\\\\'s a party, a podcast, or binge-watching, boAt and Zepto ensure the perfect audio experience is just a tap away.\\\\nA marketing campaign is an integral part of any brand\\\\\\'s effort to increase its visibility and create brand awareness.

Three ads have been created for this campaign with the voices of these three singers. They have stretched the time with their voices in such a way that it shows our habit of waiting. At the same time, Zepto implements its tagline of 10-minute delivery.\\\\nL&K Saatchi and Saatchi created this campaign very beautifully, and the whole marketing campaign turned out to be a huge success for Zepto.\\\\nIn this brand campaign, Zepto has come up with a significant collaboration featuring renowned cricketer Jasprit Bumrah as the brand ambassador. Developed by L&K Saatchi & Saatchi, the \\\\\\'Groceries delivered at Bumrah Speed\\\\\\' campaign embodies speed, precision, consistency, and rigor. This initiative not only introduces Indian audiences to cutting-edge special effects but also promises an experience comparable to the grandeur of cinema.\\\\nThe campaign\\\\\\'s focal point will be on Disney+ Hotstar, other leading OTT platforms, Zepto\\\\\\'s application, social media channels, and various digital platforms. Outdoor advertising will be prominently displayed across major cities where Zepto operates, ensuring widespread visibility and engagement.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s \\\\\\'Nahi Milega\\\\\\' brand campaign underscores its commitment, emphasizing that while life may present unattainable challenges, unlimited free deliveries on Zepto are certain.\\\\nZepto adopted an unconventional approach by introducing Uncle Ji, a character from Delhi, several weeks before unveiling their brand campaign. The intention was to disrupt social media with Uncle Ji\\\\\\'s distinctive personality, straightforward expressions of reality, and the recurring catchphrase \\\\\\'Nahi Milega\\\\\\' (won\\\\\\'t be available).\\\\nZepto said Uncle Ji\\\\\\'s character achieved remarkable organic traction, accumulating 10 million impressions with a substantial 10% engagement rate across all social media platforms. Uncle Ji trended at #6 on Twitter and received endorsements from popular Twitter celebrities and Instagram meme pages, solidifying his status as a cultural icon in India.\\\\nZepto USP\\\\nZepto‚Äôs business model focuses on customers and offers instant delivery, setting it apart from competitors.

A lot of innovative steps have been taken by the company to support and boost its business growth. Zepto\\\\\\'s target audience is generally young adults and the modern generation. Here is the detailed overview you must read.\\\\n10-Mins Delivery Strategy\\\\nThe idea of online grocery delivery is not new. Startups like Dunzo and Blinkit are already providing these services. The fact that distinguishes Zepto from all its competitors is its 10-minute delivery of groceries and other products. You might have heard about Zomato Instant, which provides food delivery within 10 minutes, but Zepto is the first player in the grocery delivery segment to offer a 10-minute grocery delivery service.\\\\nThe idea of 10-minute grocery delivery is unique, but it was not that easy to implement. To fulfill its promise to deliver groceries in the specified time, Zepto introduced the concept of the dark store model. The dark store is like a fulfillment center for Zepto; it is not accessible to the public but is efficient enough to fulfill orders rapidly.\\\\nArtificial intelligence is used by Zepto to pick, pack, and transport orders in leaps and bounds. Whenever any customer places an order, a person with a tablet is assigned to pick up and pack the order within 60 seconds. It means that at the time you make the payment, someone is already preparing your order for dispatch. The company claims that 8 minutes and 40 seconds is the average delivery time they have achieved.\\\\nZepto operates its dark store delivery within a 3 km radius, and it doesn\\\\\\'t penalize its delivery boy for late delivery.\\\\nDiscounts are a way to attract customers, but as a new player in the segment, offering huge discounts was not a sustainable option for Zepto. Hence, the 10-minute delivery strategy comes out to be a panacea for Zepto.\\\\nAdvertising and Branding Strategy\\\\nThere is not only one thing responsible for the success of Zepto, but an incredible advertising strategy has also played an important role in the success. L&K Saatchi and Saatchi is an advertising agency that was assigned to advertise Zepto and build a strong brand image in front of consumers. The main theme of all the ads is to emphasize the 10-minute delivery of Zepto.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s ads are attention-grabbing ads that suddenly capture the focus, and this is what every brand wants. When a boy suddenly wakes up and runs toward the door, it creates a question in the minds of viewers about why he is running. The twist and excitement of the ad make it capable of grabbing the attention of viewers.\\\\nIf I try to summarize the above ad in a single sentence, then it is like this: From the time you wake up until the time you sleep, every essential product will get delivered to your doorstep within 10 minutes.\\\\nEach ad that was created is meant to make the consumer feel how Zepto is capable of changing their daily grocery shopping habit. Since advertising is the best way to market the product and build a strong brand image, Zepto has fully utilized the benefits of marketing.\\\\nAdvertising was not only done on social media channels, but it also planted its hoardings in the streets of cities in which Zepto\\\\\\'s services are operational.\\\\nSocial Media Meme Marketing\\\\nIn today\\\\\\'s generation of technology and innovation, we cannot ignore the power of social media. There is a huge chance you\\\\\\'ll find your target audience on the social media platform. Hence, every brand is focusing on social media marketing. Zepto is also not behind the race; it leverages the social platform to engage its audience through meme marketing.\\\\nFor the recently released movie \\\\\\'Avatar: The Way of Water,\\\\\\' Zepto created a meme to grab the consumer\\\\\\'s attention by following the ongoing trend. It\\\\\\'s just one example, but if you visit Zepto\\\\\\'s social media page, you\\\\\\'ll find plenty of such memes.\\\\nMeme marketing is a trend today because people often share memes with their loved ones. This will help the brand get some organic reach and, at the same time, promote the brand. Zepto knows the power of memes very well. That\\\\\\'s why if you open their page on any platform like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, you\\\\\\'ll find amazing memes.\\\\nTh has gained a lot of positive feedback from customers. Along with meme marketing, they sometimes collaborate with famous social media influencers to make videos for them. This tactic helps to create a loyal fanbase and also helps the brand image flourish.\\\\nMicro-Moments Marketing Strategy\\\\nMicro-moments are key moments in a customer\\\\\\'s journey where brands can influence buying decisions. Zepto understands this and focuses on sending the right messages at the right time to connect with customers. Studies show that over 150 billion mobile micro-moments happen every day, influencing more than 70% of purchases. Brands using this approach see a 74% success rate in increasing revenue.\\\\nCustomer Acquisition and Retention Strategy\\\\nPlayers in the quick commerce industry like Dunzo, Swiggy Instamart, and Blinkit are well-funded and established. These big giants have already acquired a huge market share in the segment by offering huge discounts and other offers. So it was not easy for Zepto to acquire customers and retain them.\\\\nDiscounts are not the only things that attract consumers. Consumers are always hungry for something new, and exactly here, Zepto played its game. Acquisition of customers and retaining customers are two different things. Other players in the segment have easily acquired customers but struggled to retain them.\\\\nCustomers are used to switching platforms and ordering items from the app, where the discount is heavy. In the case of Zepto, it has given discounts and at the same time provided high-speed free delivery. It helps to enhance Zepto\\\\\\'s retention rate significantly.\\\\nNo other players in the segment were making that fast delivery. This eventually leads to an increase in Zepto\\\\\\'s consumer base.\\\\nDigital Marketing\\\\nZepto uses digital marketing to reach busy customers with fast and targeted ads. They focus on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook to promote quick delivery and special offers. Zepto also uses precision messaging or micro-moments to engage customers when they are likely to make a purchase. Through online campaigns, Zepto builds brand awareness and encourages customers to use their service for fast grocery deliveries.\\\\nReferral Programs\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s referral program plays a crucial role in its successful marketing strategy. The program offers unique codes to its users for sharing, which incentivizes both existing and new users with rewards such as discounts. This helps in cost-effective customer acquisition and increases customer retention. The program\\\\\\'s seamless integration with social media, multiple reward options, and gamification elements make it a dynamic and impactful tool for Zepto\\\\\\'s growth and customer loyalty.\\\\nBeyond transactional benefits, Zepto\\\\\\'s referral initiative is a brand-building powerhouse, fostering advocacy and community engagement. By creating a positive customer experience and utilizing word-of-mouth influence, the program stands as a testament to the brand\\\\\\'s commitment to customer satisfaction and strategic marketing prowess.\\\\nPartnerships with Influencers\\\\nZepto partners with social media influencers who create authentic content to showcase its services. This helps Zepto build trust, connect with specific audiences, and reach more customers. This approach has fueled rapid growth, with the company raising over $300 million in just one year, emphasizing its focus on long-term customer relationships.\\\\nMarketing Campaign of Zepto\\\\nboAt, India‚Äôs leading audio brand, has teamed up with Zepto to bring high-quality audio products to your doorstep in just 10 minutes. This partnership combines boAt‚Äôs top-notch audio expertise with Zepto‚Äôs quick delivery, making it easier to enjoy music, movies, podcasts, and more. Whether it\\\\\\'s a party, a podcast, or binge-watching, boAt and Zepto ensure the perfect audio experience is just a tap away.\\\\nA marketing campaign is an integral part of any brand\\\\\\'s effort to increase its visibility and create brand awareness. The same is true for Zepto. In the IPL 2022, Zepto created and ran a marketing campaign that truly had a new approach.\\\\nMost of the time, we have faced the issue of time stretching in different places like airports, hospitals, and restaurants. Because we usually wait for a long time in these places, it became quite common for us, but Zepto addressed this issue and showcased it in its campaign in such a way that, at the same time, it also represented the 10-minute delivery promise of Zepto.\\\\nIn this campaign, three famous singers‚ÄîShankar Mahadevan, Usha Uthup, and Kailash Kher‚Äîhave given their incredible voices. Three ads have been created for this campaign with the voices of these three singers. They have stretched the time with their voices in such a way that it shows our habit of waiting. At the same time, Zepto implements its tagline of 10-minute delivery.\\\\nL&K Saatchi and Saatchi created this campaign very beautifully, and the whole marketing campaign turned out to be a huge success for Zepto.\\\\nIn this brand campaign, Zepto has come up with a significant collaboration featuring renowned cricketer Jasprit Bumrah as the brand ambassador. Developed by L&K Saatchi & Saatchi, the \\\\\\'Groceries delivered at Bumrah Speed\\\\\\' campaign embodies speed, precision, consistency, and rigor. This initiative not only introduces Indian audiences to cutting-edge special effects but also promises an experience comparable to the grandeur of cinema.\\\\nThe campaign\\\\\\'s focal point will be on Disney+ Hotstar, other leading OTT platforms, Zepto\\\\\\'s application, social media channels, and various digital platforms. Outdoor advertising will be prominently displayed across major cities where Zepto operates, ensuring widespread visibility and engagement.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s \\\\\\'Nahi Milega\\\\\\' brand campaign underscores its commitment, emphasizing that while life may present unattainable challenges, unlimited free deliveries on Zepto are certain.\\\\nZepto adopted an unconventional approach by introducing Uncle Ji, a character from Delhi, several weeks before unveiling their brand campaign.

As a consequence of social distancing constraints, consumers are converting to online grocery shopping, which is not only convenient but also safer.\\\\nZepto - Founders and Team\\\\nAadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, both 19-year-old childhood pals, founded Zepto after walking out of Stanford University\\\\\\'s renowned computer science department to return to their home country, India, and start up a business. The Zepto company began its operations in April 2021.\\\\nKaivalya Vohra\\\\nKaivalya Vohra is the CTO and Co-Founder of Zepto. He was also the founder and CTO of KiranaKart. He also attended Stanford University to pursue a degree in Computer Science, but like Aadit, he decided to leave the university. Kaivalya, along with Aadit, participated in Y Combinator as well.\\\\nAadit Palicha\\\\nAadit Palicha is the CEO and Co-Founder of Zepto. He was also the founder and CEO of KiranaKart.

Inviting founders and startups who are building sustainable solutions from ground zero! Startups who run the show, StartupTalky will let the world know!\\\\nZepto - Startup Story\\\\nMany of us have \"startup ideas,\" but even the most creative among us struggle to see them through. Palicha and Vohra had both enrolled at Stanford to earn a Computer Science degree but had dropped out to follow their business passions instead.\\\\nThe story of Zepto started during the COVID-19 outbreak. The concept for Zepto sprang from the limitations of their houses. A surge in demand for delivery services meant that groceries and other necessities would arrive in a couple of days, creating a void for quick delivery. As a result, Zepto was created with all this insight.\\\\nThese teenagers were abruptly detained, because of Covid norms, detained in their Mumbai homes after significant collaboration on many projects, including a ride-hailing commuting app for kids. Even while grocery delivery, which was deemed important by local authorities, was still permitted across much of the nation as the virus spread, the duo battled to get their provisions as the illness expanded.\\\\nWhile Zepto is the focus of attention, Palicha and Vohra\\\\\\'s first venture, KiranaKart, did not receive the same acclaim. Zepto, on the other hand, is inspired by KiranaKart. KiranaKart, as its name implies, was a supermarket delivery service. It had made arrangements with Kirana merchants to provide groceries in 45 minutes or less. A $730,000 pre-seed round was led by Global Founders Capital, 2 AM Ventures, Contrary Capital, and angel investors. At the time, Vohra and Palicha planned to make the first 1.5 lakh deliveries for INR 1.\\\\nZepto - Mission and Vision\\\\nAs two bachelors living alone, the founders found it most difficult to obtain food, therefore, they focused their applications on grocery delivery. So, whereas KiranaKart, their first startup, tried to make grocery delivery easier for Kiranas, Zepto aims to shorten delivery times.\\\\nZepto - Name, Logo, and Tagline\\\\nThe firm, which uses the term \"Zepto\" to denote \"a factor of 10‚Åª¬≤¬π, i.e. 0.000000000000000000001,\" named after a minuscule unit of time, offers a 10-minute grocery delivery service, surpassing numerous well-funded competitors.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s tagline says, \"Groceries delivered in 10 minutes\".\\\\nZepto - Business and Revenue Model\\\\nZepto delivers groceries in ten minutes through a system of dark storefronts and mini-warehouses, on up to 90% of orders. Zepto works in the quick commerce segment of India. It is designed to be customer-centric and built around the instant service model.\\\\nTo ensure a flawless delivery experience, Aadit says that their average delivery time is 8 minutes and 47 seconds. Through a chain of dark stores or retail distribution centers, the Mumbai-based company employs a hotspot method to cater largely to digital purchases.\\\\nA dark store is a tiny neighborhood storehouse that customers cannot visit but purchase online to get packaged delivery. While dark stores are not new to the Indian industry, Aadit believes that the idea has yet to be completely explored. Population, traffic dynamics, topography, road patterns, weather conditions, last-mile operational improvement, real estate prices, and other geographic data and local intelligence aid Zepto in optimizing its connectivity. Furthermore, the startup\\\\\\'s dark warehouses and cool rooms are custom-designed to satisfy particular criteria such as ease of travel, allowing packers to move as swiftly as possible to fill orders.\\\\nLocation intelligence and geographic data, such as topography, population, road patterns, traffic dynamics, weather, last-mile supply availability, real estate values, and so on, are said to help Zepto optimize its network.\\\\nZepto - Funding and Investors\\\\nZepto, the Mumbai-based quick commerce unicorn, achieved unicorn status in August 2023 after raising $200 million in a Series E funding round, which brought its valuation to $1.4 billion. This milestone marked the end of India\\\\\\'s 11-month unicorn drought. The Series E round was led by The StepStone Group, with participation from Goodwater Capital and existing investors.\\\\nIn June 2024, Zepto raised $665 million, which valued the company at $3.6 billion. Just a few months later, on August 30, 2024, Zepto raised $340 million in Series G funding, which increased its valuation to $5 billion. The Series G round was led by General Catalyst, with Dragon Fund and Epiq Capital joining as new investors. Existing backers such as StepStone, Lightspeed, DST, and Contrary also increased their investments, reflecting strong confidence in Zepto\\\\\\'s growth potential.\\\\nIn November 2024, Zepto raised another $350 million from a group of domestic investors, led by Motilal Oswal\\\\\\'s private wealth division, at a flat valuation of $5 billion. This brings the total funding raised by Zepto to $2 billion.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s initial seed funding in September 2020 was led by Contrary.\\\\n| Date | Round | Amount | Lead Investors |\\\\n|---|---|---|---|\\\\n| November 21, 2024 | Series G | $350 | Motilal Oswal Wealth |\\\\n| August 30, 2024 | Series G | $340 million | General Catalyst, Mars Growth Capital |\\\\n| June 21, 2024 | Series F | $665 million | Glade Brook Capital Partners, Nexus Venture Partners, StepStone Group |\\\\n| Nov 8, 2023 | Series E | $31.3 million | Goodwater Capital, Nexus Venture Partners |\\\\n| Aug 25, 2023 | Series E | $200 million | StepStone Group |\\\\n| May 2, 2022 | Series D | $200 million | Y Combinator Continuity Fund |\\\\n| Dec 20, 2021 | Series C | $100 million | Y Combinator Continuity Fund |\\\\n| Oct 31, 2021 | Series B | $60 million | Glade Brook Capital Partners |\\\\n| Mar 22, 2021 | Series A | $6.5 million | Nexus Venture Partners |\\\\n| Sep 1, 2020 | Pre Seed Round | - | Contrary |\\\\nZepto - Shareholding\\\\nZepto shareholding pattern as of October 2024 (source: Tracxn):\\\\n| Zepto Shareholders | Percentage |\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n| Aadit Palicha | 0.9% |\\\\n| Kaivalya Vohra | 0.7% |\\\\n| Nexus Venture Partners | 18.6% |\\\\n| Glade Brook Capital | 10.3% |\\\\n| StepStone Group | 9.8% |\\\\n| Y Combinator | 8.7% |\\\\n| LGF Scale I | 7.8% |\\\\n| Rocket Internet | 3.0% |\\\\n| General Catalyst | 4.1% |\\\\n| Goodwater Capital | 1.8% |\\\\n| Razor\\\\\\'s Edge Ventures | 1.6% |\\\\n| Contrary | 1.6% |\\\\n| Kaiser Permanente | 2.3% |\\\\n| avra | 1.3% |\\\\n| SpringBlue Capital | 1.0% |\\\\n| Lightspeed Venture Partners | 0.8% |\\\\n| Global Founders Capital | 0.8% |\\\\n| Crimson | 0.5% |\\\\n| Vanderbilt University | 0.3% |\\\\n| Mangum | 0.3% |\\\\n| Bayhouse Capital | 0.2% |\\\\n| Mehta Ventures | <0.1% |\\\\n| Contrary Capital | <0.1% |\\\\n| Zpt Holdings | 2.1% |\\\\n| AZ04 | 1.4% |\\\\n| Kiranakart SPV | 0.6% |\\\\n| Sayacorps | 0.4% |\\\\n| C Opportunities | 0.1% |\\\\n| Jung Lish Lee | 2.3% |\\\\n| Oliver Jung | 0.7% |\\\\n| Oleg Wladimir Nicolas Tscheltzoff | 0.2% |\\\\n| Aditi Javesh Jhaveri | <0.1% |\\\\n| Manoj Chawla | <0.1% |\\\\n| Kavit Dilip Palicha | 8.0% |\\\\n| Jaideep Vohra | 6.7% |\\\\n| Other Investors | 1.0% |\\\\nAmong the shareholders, Nexus Venture Partners holds the largest stake, holding 18.6% of Zepto.

To prepare for its IPO, the company set up a new entity, Zepto Marketplace Private Limited, in October 2024 to simplify its operations. Zepto currently operates under a B2B model, sourcing products directly from brands and selling them to its partner companies, which then distribute the products to customers under a licensing agreement.\\\\nIn January 2025, Zepto completed its domicile shift from Singapore to India ahead of its IPO, which is now expected to raise between $800 million and $1 billion, including secondaries. Initially, the company targeted a $450 million primary capital raise.\\\\nZepto has hired Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Axis Capital as advisors for the IPO. This marks a key step in its journey as a leader in the quick commerce industry.\\\\nZepto - Growth and Revenue\\\\nZepto has seen impressive growth, serving 10 major cities with 1,000+ employees. They deliver more than 5,000 products, revolutionizing the Indian grocery segment with 10-minute delivery, advanced tech, and optimized centers.\\\\nEngineering, operations, marketing, and financial positions are also available at Zepto. Palicha claims that month-over-month growth is 200%, with a monthly retention rate of 78%.\\\\n‚ÄúWe are looking at a pretty crazy runrate,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIn the past one and a half months, we have grown our business by 10 times. And now we are working to grow another 10 times by February or March,‚Äù said Palicha in December 2021.\\\\nZepto, when it was a five-month-old startup, had secured a valuation of $570 million after raising $100 million in a Series C round headed by Y Combinator\\\\\\'s Continuity Fund, which was a 2X increase from its previous valuation of $60 million only 45 days before that. Zepto raised another round led by Y Combinator to lift its valuation further to $900 million, so there is certainly impressive growth that the company has received in funding as well.\\\\nAnother positive development for Zepto has been the expertise it has been able to acquire. Plenty of well-known senior executives from Uber, Flipkart, Dream11, Amazon, and Pharmeasy have joined the team.\\\\nAccording to Palicha, one of the reasons why several entrepreneurs have chosen Zepto is that it has enabled individuals who had transferred from Mumbai to Bangalore to come back to their homes. He says, nevertheless, that the startup\\\\\\'s rapid development, rigorous execution, and ambitions have captivated others who share his interests. \"We\\\\\\'ve been able to walk the walk,\" he said.\\\\n‚ÄúThey originally launched with a different model, swiftly pivoted to quick commerce in August 2021 and are now adding 100,000 new customers every week, 60% of them women. Their attention to detail on the logistics experience is unparalleled and this has enabled them to scale to most major metros in just 5 months. Simply put, we‚Äôre confident Zepto will win in this space over the long-term,\" said Anu Hariharan, a partner at Y Combinator, in a statement.\\\\nZepto has demonstrated significant growth in recent times, with the majority of its dark stores now operating profitably. According to co-founder and CEO Aadit Palicha, Zepto has successfully established its presence in major metro cities in India with over 300-400 dark stores. Impressively, approximately 50‚Äì60 percent of these dark stores have started generating cash flows, indicating the effectiveness of Zepto\\\\\\'s business model and operational strategies.

YoloBus and Acko were two other companies that dealt with the same before.\\\\nZepto - Advertisements and Social Media Campaigns\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s marketing strategy has been a key driver of its rapid growth in the quick-commerce industry.

What is Zepto‚Äôs Business Model?\\\\nThere‚Äôs both a simple and a complex way of introducing Zepto‚Äôs Business Model.\\\\nIn simple words - You order groceries from Zepto and they deliver it to your location. They make money out of this process.\\\\nLet‚Äôs say that you have some visitors home. You want some sweets and a packet of chips to serve your guests. So you would go to Zepto, choose all the items you want to order, pay for it and get it in under 10 minutes.\\\\nBut here‚Äôs everything Zepto has to do to get those product to your home in under 10 mins ‚è¨\\\\nRent a warehouse and assemble their dark store\\\\nHire delivery executives to deliver your order\\\\nHire folks to handle all the packing, arranging & all other operational tasks inside the warehouse\\\\nHire folks to handle support when things don‚Äôt go as planned\\\\nSpeak to local suppliers to get the groceries and other supplies to their dark store\\\\nBuild an app to display all the items for the customers\\\\nSpeak to UPI aggregators, banks & other financial institutions to setup seamless payment systems for you\\\\nBuild in-house systems to communicate your order to the operational staff\\\\nBuild in-house systems to help the delivery executive pickup orders and deliver them safely\\\\n& so much more‚Ä¶.\\\\nWhatever you see on your smartphone is only possible because of a ton of moving parts that seem to be seamlessly fixed with each other. This is the very simple answer to Zepto‚Äôs Business Model ü§üüèº\\\\nTo understand the complex version of Zepto‚Äôs business model, you can jump to the relevant section using the quick links below\\\\nTo breakdown this craziness behind the 10 min delivery, our team downloaded Zepto and made a quick order. We made sure that the order contained a mix of meat, fruits & milk (their highest margin items). Zepto delivered this order in less than 13 minutes!\\\\nWe also looked at a ton of user interviews and founder interviews on YouTube to understand the Zepto business model in depth.\\\\nEverything you see here is a result of mix of original research gathered from the internet and the users of Zepto. Here are the 5 key pieces that allow Zepto to deliver your order in 10 minutes or less!\\\\n1. Darkstores & Microwarehouses:\\\\nDarkstores are physical warehouses where all the items you see on the Zepto app are placed in. When you order anything, a Zepto delivery executive picks up all your items from one of these dark stores and brings it to you.\\\\nUnlike traditional retail stores, you cannot go to a dark store and buy your grocery items. Dark stores can only be accessed by Zepto‚Äôs team members and their vendors.\\\\nDark stores are the sole reason why Zepto is able to deliver some orders in under 10 minutes. By being in close proximity to a dense urban are, they are able to deliver your order quickly.\\\\nFor example, let‚Äôs consider Indiranagar in Bangalore.\\\\nBy placing a warehouse in this location, Zepto will be able to service all these neighbourhoods in under 10 minutes.\\\\nIf the order frequency and retention is good, the dark stores will max out almost instantly. Then they could either add more deliver partners to the same dark store or simplu open up one more dark store nearby!\\\\nWhat happens if that dark store also reaches a bottleneck?\\\\nIn that case, Zepto opens up another dark store to meet demands.\\\\nBut thanks to their experienced leadership team, all these expansion decisions are backed by data. They take into account geography, future growth potential, traffic, weather, driver availability & much more before they even think about opening a new dark store.\\\\n2. Super Quick Packaging\\\\nThe founding principles of Zepto has always been impeccable operations backed by custom built software. That‚Äôs how they scaled their first store and that‚Äôs the same principle they‚Äôre using for all their stores across India.\\\\nOnce you place an order, an operations executive inside their warehouse will get two things\\\\nA list of all the items in your orders\\\\nA map to navigate themselves inside the warehouse to pickup all the items in the least amount of time\\\\nThe second point is what truly allows Zepto to become a kingpin on operational efficiency üöÄ. As their CTO Kaivalya Arora says, ‚ÄòWe have designed the process to make sure the entire order is dispacted in 60 - 90 seconds‚Äô\\\\nThis means that the rest of the time is entirely spent on the last mile delivery, thereby easing some pressure on the delivery partner.\\\\nThis brings us onto our third point\\\\n3. Internal Structure of the warehouses\\\\nOperational efficiency is the name of the game when it comes to any operations heavy business. And Zepto achieves operational efficiency in a class of its own üßóüèº‚ôÄÔ∏è.\\\\nThe operations have streamlined the entire warehouse with a data led approach. They‚Äôve looked at the items which move the quickest and have placed it closer to the entrance. Groceries which are not frequenlty ordered are de-prioritised and placed at the back.\\\\nThe creative below will give you an idea of how a darkstore might be structured based on the order frequency of different items. Although this structure is just an example and is subject to change based on several other factors.\\\\nBut Multiply this structural formula with item size, refrigeration needs, fragility & you will get a repeatable model of how to design all your warehouses at scale üöÄ\\\\nFor example, fruits & vegetables are one of their most important and highest margin categories. Hence they have decided to place them in shelves closer to the entrance, where they‚Äôre very easy grab and place into delivery bags.\\\\nTo draw parallels, this is very similar to how the founders of McDonalds designed their Kitchen to complete customer orders in less than two minutes ü§Ø\\\\nIf you haven‚Äôt seen ‚ÄòThe Founder‚Äô on Netflix, this is an open call to see it ASAP. If you‚Äôre working in an operations heavy business or interested in building one, please remember that operational efficiency is crucial for your long term success.\\\\nBut, how do you design superfast systems even when human decisions are part of the system?\\\\nA human operator has to look at the order and decide the chronological order of items in the delivery bag. This takes time and there is also the risk of human errors. Items might be missed or fragile items might end up getting placed at the bottom of the bag (No one likes to have their eggs & tomatoes crushed under a watermelon ‚òπÔ∏è)\\\\nSo the team came up with a pretty simple solution - Give a tablet like device to each operations executive in the darkstore. It works like a Google map, guiding the executive to pickup the items placed in the warehouse.\\\\nOnce the operator is assigned an order, they are told where and how to pick each item in a chronological order.\\\\nTheir CTO Kaivalya says ‚ÄúWe wanted to remove human decisions as much as possible. So each of our executives have a handheld software device driving them through the most optimal pathway‚Äù\\\\nThis system works like a charm and has allowed them to exponentially open new dark stores across India üöÄ, while maintaining quality control.\\\\n4. Incredibly short distances to delivery:\\\\nBigBasket took anywhere between 3 hours to a day to deliver a bag of groceries, while Zepto does it in 10 minutes. A lot of this speed is heavily owed to a warehouse that is present in close proximity to an urban location. This is just simple physics bringing down the time of the last mile delivery.\\\\nSince the distances are closer, the delivery executives are also able to fulfill their orders quicker. Moreover with customers who order frequently, Zepto can assign the same set of delivery partners to fullfil their orders. Since they are well acquainted with the location of the customers, this brings the Time To Deliver even lower üëçüèº.\\\\n5. Driver‚Äôs Familiarity with their locality:\\\\nThe operations team at Swiggy use incredibly sophisticated Machine Learning models to bring down the total deliver time. Right from choosing which partner gets which order to how many order each partner picks up.\\\\nThis allows the delivery partner to\\\\nPickup multiple order and deliver them on the way\\\\nDeliver one order and pickup an order from a nearby hotel\\\\nTo even give you a rough estimation, Swiggy has to calculate four things before assigning a delivery partner to your order.\\\\nThis gets more complex when the delivery executive has to pickup one more order or has to deliver one more order on the way to your house.\\\\nIf you thought that was complex, think about assigning a delivery partner at random. Sometimes they might be familiar with your area. Sometimes they might not be familiar with your locality. Now combine this with traffic and other humane errors!\\\\nWith Zepto, some of these problems like Prep Time are naturally removed due to the nature of the business. Since the drivers are also operating in a familiar locality, the first mile & last mile times are brought down significantly.\\\\nHere‚Äôs how the Zepto would calculate time for a delivery partner who‚Äôs already at the darkstore\\\\nThe human factor is definitely one of the bigger advantages of Zepto. In a matter of weeks, the delivery partners become familiar with each road and each shortcut. Familiarity breeds speed and the delivery partners get quick with time.\\\\nIf you‚Äôre interested about how Swiggy does their driver routing, please do give this and this a read üëçüèº\\\\n2. How does Zepto make money üí∏?\\\\nWe‚Äôve seen how Zepto operates from a micro and a macro view. They store groceries in a darkstore and deliver them with the help of their delivery partners. But all this seems like a costly affair to run. They have to pay rent for each darkstore, salaries for darkstore operators & payments for delivery partners. These are fixed operating costs to Zepto.\\\\nAdd this on top of the tech, product & marketing costs, it‚Äôll give you a fair idea of the amount of money required to keep Zepto alive. So how does Zepto earn money selling groceries?\\\\nHere are the five ways they are currently earning money ü§ë, along with one potential way Zepto they can earn money in the future üöÄ\\\\n1. Margins on each individual product:\\\\nThe most common way grocery delivery startups earn money is on the margins of each individual product. This model is similar to the retailers who buy goods at a lower cost from distributors and sell it at a higher price ‚úÖ\\\\nFor example, let‚Äôs assume that Zepto sells a kg of onion for a price of 24 rupees. They earn margins on this by buying a large quantity from a distributor at a lower price.\\\\nWe went to the internet and checked for prices of onions from distributors. The prices range from anywhere between 10 rupees/ kg to 20 rupees/ kg.\\\\nIf they are able to tie up with a buyer at the lowest price, this is definitely a win win for both of them. Because Zepto gets onion at a lower price and the distributor also gets his order fulfilled almost frequently leading to repeatable revenue numbers.\\\\nFor starters we did some calculations as to how much revenue Zepto could earn from just one warehouse and from onion üß†\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume that Zepto orders 100 kg of onion for one of its warehouses in Bandra every day.\\\\nThe price of one kilogram of onion comes around to 10 rupees.\\\\nSo let‚Äôs assume that the total cost to Zepto along with transportation is 1200 rupees.\\\\nLet‚Äôs also assume an ideal state where they are able to sell the entire 100 kg over the same day.\\\\nWe know that zepto currently sells onion at a price of 24 rupees/ kg.\\\\nNow that‚Äôs 2400 rupees before taxes & other charges.\\\\nNot bad for 100 kgs of onion sold in just one darkstore.\\\\nAccording to their CTO, Kaivalya -‚ÄùPotatoes, Onion, Tomatoes are some of our highest selling items on Zepto. Fruits & vegetables also happen to be one of the highest margin items on our platform‚Äù\\\\nOnion is just one category here. One look into Zepto and you‚Äôll see hundreds of vegetables, fruits, and quick perishable items, all of which are high margin items on Zepto!\\\\n2. Handling Charges\\\\nHandling charge is the fee collected by Zepto to organise, pack and dispatch the items on your list. We clicked on the ‚Äòinformation‚Äô button to understand more about this handling charge and we were thrown the following message - ‚ÄúHandling charge is levied to ensure the products are handled, packed & dispatched safely‚Äù\\\\nWe tried to see if a handling charge is levied by all grocery delivery platforms in India\\\\nSwiggy Instamart - Yes, they had a handling charge\\\\nBigBasket NOW - They had something called a delivery token, but it seemed very similar to this handling charge\\\\nBlinkit - Surprisingly, they did not have a handling charge\\\\nWe figured that the handling charge was not a set standard across all grocery delivery platforms. So this is something that is levied by platforms in different ways.\\\\n3. Delivery Charges\\\\nThis is the second bigger piece of solving the profitability equation for most delivery grocery startups. Delivery charge is a big incredibly important for solving profitability because\\\\nNo matter the size of the order, Zepto has to pay the same delivery fee to their delivery partner\\\\nBut high delivery charges can also be a reason why users stop buying from Zepto\\\\nThe key here is to find the balance between waiving delivery charges and growing profitably üí™üèº. Zepto has solved this problem by choosing to charge customers for orders with a low value basket size. However if you break a certain threshold, you‚Äôll unlock the option to get a ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô\\\\nIncreasing the threshold to unlock free delivery does two things\\\\nIncreases the AOV of each order by encouraging customer to order more\\\\nImprove revenue by charging delivery fee on orders with low AOV\\\\nThe net benefit is aimed at increasing overall revenue from the ‚Äòdelivery fee‚Äô lever. But it might also reduce the overall order frequency for certain ICPs who are Power users. High delivery fees might discourage users who use Zepto to order everything at the last minute.\\\\nHence this a profit lever the ‚ÄòGrowth Team‚Äô must constantly tweak and experiment with data!\\\\nBut the fact is that people are tier 1 cities are increasingly favouring CONVENIENCE >>> MONEY. Our hypothesis is that most folks won‚Äôt mind paying a delivery fee of 25 - 50 get their order delivered.\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume that Sheila orders from Zepto 6 times a week\\\\n‚Üí Even if she gets 3 free deliveries a week, we still have 3 deliveries where Zepto earns a revenue\\\\n‚Üí If she‚Äôs paying 35/ delivery, that‚Äôs 105 rupees for a week.\\\\n‚Üí Extrapolate that across a month and Zepto has earned a revenue of 420 rupees.\\\\n‚Üí Assuming there are 100 customers like her in one dark store, Zepto has just earned 42,000 rupees just from deliveries.\\\\nYou should note that these these numbers are highly speculative and can vary a lot. But you get the gist. Done right, Zepto can find a balance between earning from delivery charges while also maintaining the user frequency ü´Ç\\\\nOne interesting fact to note that if your order is less than 50 rupees, Zepto levies a fee of ‚ÄòSmall Cart Fee‚Äô of Rupees 35. This will incentivise the user to add more to their cart quite naturally!\\\\n4. Product Customisations:\\\\nUser Research is something we push actively in the GrowthX experience. Before you hypothesize any solution, you should always seek to understand your users and their problems.\\\\nIn Zepto‚Äôs case, it‚Äôs safe to say that they‚Äôve identified their customers and their problems incredibly well. One good example is under their fruits and vegetables section\\\\nRight from peeled onion, to cut carrots & loose corn. They have identified ways to take existing vegetables, customize them and increase their prices üöÄ\\\\nFor example:\\\\n500 grams of carrot costs 45 rupees.\\\\nBringing it down to 100 grams this costs just 9 rupees.\\\\nBut 200 grams of peeled carrots costs 53 rupees on Zepto.\\\\nBringing this down to 100 grams costs a whopping 26 rupees\\\\nBy simply washing and cutting up the carrots, they have found ways to increase their margins on their products.\\\\nSimple economics shows a 300% increase in price ü§Ø just by customising the product a bit.\\\\nSure you‚Äôll have to buy expensive machinery or employ people to help with these customisation. But if Zepto is able to achieve good volumes, this cost will also go down as it‚Äôs fixed!\\\\nZepto definitely nailed ‚ÄòPeople don‚Äôt buy your product, they buy the solution that can be achieved with your product‚Äô ü§òüèº\\\\n5. Product Ads:\\\\nProduct Ads are a proven way to earn predictable revenue in most e-commerce and marketplace businesses. Zepto also pulls this off Product Ads in a flawless manner\\\\nAlmost everyone in the grocery space uses product ads as a monetary lever.\\\\nThe concept is simple: If you‚Äôre a retailer, you can give money to Zepto to feature your products at the top of certain searches & categories.\\\\nFor example, Bru features their ‚ÄòBru Instant Pure Coffee Jar‚Äô at the first position for the keyword ‚Äòcoffee.\\\\n6. Membership:\\\\nThis is a model Zepto hasn‚Äôt experimented yet, but proves to a very solid model for predictable revenue growth. Swiggy has already rolled out this membership model in the name of ‚ÄòSwiggy One‚Äô.\\\\nBy subscribing to their membership, you can get\\\\nFree deliveries on all orders\\\\nNo surge fees\\\\nBetter discounts\\\\nOther ecommerce startups also have similar models like\\\\nAmazon‚Äôs ‚ÄòAmazon Prime‚Äô,\\\\nFlipkart‚Äôs ‚ÄòFlipkart Plus‚Äô &\\\\nMeesho‚Äôs upcoming membership model.\\\\nThe membership will model will allow Zepto to predict how their revenue will grow with certainty. It can also be beneficial since it increase customer retention and serves as a good moat!\\\\nWe will have to wait and see if Zepto also rolls out this feature in the future!\\\\nüí°\\\\nBy the way, the depth you see here is just a feeler of the depth we teach at GrowthX üí´\\\\nGrowthX is an invite-only club of over 3000 members who are product, marketing, and business leaders, and founders from top internet-first companies like Google, Canva, CRED, Stripe, Netflix, and more üíé\\\\nWe teach our members how to scale revenues via frameworks that can be applied starting next Monday morning.

This growth is possible because they had a structured approach to growth in the first place. Be it creating marketing copies or opening up new darkstores, everything has a structure in place.\\\\nIn this section we will create a structured Growth strategy for Zepto to reach a business goal in a specific period of time.\\\\n1. Who is Zepto‚Äôs Ideal customer?\\\\nBefore we nail down on Zepto‚Äôs ICP, let‚Äôs look at a couple of practical use cases of Zepto\\\\nYou have a few visitors at home and you need to serve them snacks. Maybe you order some fruits and snack items on Zepto for your visitors\\\\nYou are prepping for breakfast when you realise the batter you have has expired. So you go to Zepto and order for some fresh ID dosa batter\\\\nYou are preparing lunch when you realise that you don‚Äôt have any onions left for dinner. Maybe you order some onions along with a fresh set of groceries for the next three days\\\\nYou feel the need to snack and want some biscuits and chips. So you go to Zepto to order some snacks along with essential groceries for the week\\\\nYou step into the washroom to brush your teeth, only to realise you are out of paste. You quickly open Zepto and get some paste delivered in the next 10 minutes\\\\nThese are just a tiny subset of the use cases of Zepto. Also most of these examples were just around groceries. Zepto also has a ton of other sub categories like\\\\nCleaning Essentials\\\\nMakeup items\\\\nBaby care\\\\nBath & Body care\\\\nElectricals & Accessories\\\\n& much more\\\\nA simple probability check will show you that the use cases are in the thousands (and growing as Zepto plans to add new categories ü§òüèº). Before you build any growth strategy, you need to find a way to bucket these millions of users & use cases into something consumable.\\\\nThis look into Zepto‚Äôs ideal customer is nothing perfect. But it will give you a solid foundation into Zepto‚Äôs primary users.\\\\nWe have borrowed these insights from the assignment submitted by one of our members - Aadeesh Deshpande (GX12).

Understanding the market (TAM, SAM, SOM)\\\\nIn an interview with Master‚Äôs Union, their CTO Kaivalya Arora says ‚Äúwe went from 5 to 77+ dark stores from Sep to Dec, 2022‚Äù\\\\nThis massive growth is backed by some of the top investors in the market like Nexus, Glade Brook & YCombinator. This is even after there are tons of grocery startups in the market like Instamart, Blinkit and let‚Äôs not forget Tata‚Äôs BigBasket!\\\\nThis is possible because of the nature & scale of the grocery business in India üáÆüá≥\\\\nTheir CEO points the scale of the grocery & essential industry in a beautiful way - ‚ÄúDmart has built a $40 Billion dollar business in a matter of 20 years. If we can even capture a portion of that volume, we can build a profitable business effectively‚Äù\\\\nSo the question is\\\\n‚ùì\\\\nHow big is the grocery market and how much market share is available for Zepto?\\\\nIndia is a massive country with a total population of 1.5 billion people ü§Ø\\\\nBut Zepto cannot cater to this entire base as most of them are located in Tier 2+ cities & rural areas. Maybe Zepto will tap everyone in India (in the future) or maybe we‚Äôll have a Tier 2+ focused startup like Meesho focusing on just that market!\\\\nBut for the foreseeable future, Zepto will only be focusing on the folks living in Tier1+ cities with Annual salaries greater than 10 lakh/ annum\\\\nKartik Narang (GX10), a fellow GrowthX member and Capabilities & Insights Analyst McKinsey laid out this TAM calculation in an incredible manner in one of his acquisition assignmentsüöÄ\\\\nCondition\\\\nCalculation\\\\nTotal Population in Tier 1 Cities in India\\\\n70 Million\\\\nPercentage of People between 20 & 40 years of age\\\\n40%\\\\nTotal Population in Tier 1 cities between the age of 20 - 40\\\\n28 Million\\\\nPercentage of Annual Income greater than 10 lakhs\\\\n40%\\\\nTotal Population in Tier 1 cities between the age 20 - 40 with Annual Income greater than 10 lakhs\\\\n11.2 Million\\\\nAverage number of people per household\\\\n4\\\\nTotal Number of houses that can be reached\\\\n11.2/ 4 ‚áí 3 Million households\\\\n„Ö§\\\\n„Ö§\\\\nThe total TAM in terms of the number of households can be assumed anywhere between 3 to 7 million based on the variations in the following categories\\\\nSwati Poddar (GX9), another fellow GrowthX member and PM at Walmart has smartly converted this into revenue numbers by multiplying the TAM with the average spend on groceries for each household. This was also an acquisition assignment as part of the GrowthX learning experience.\\\\nüí°\\\\nBy the way, the depth you see here is just a feeler of the depth we teach at GrowthX üí´\\\\nGrowthX is an invite-only club of over 3000 members who are product, marketing, and business leaders, and founders from top internet-first companies like Google, Canva, CRED, Stripe, Netflix, and more üíé\\\\nWe teach our members how to scale revenues via frameworks that can be applied starting next Monday morning.

But this doesn‚Äôt mean that one of their calculations are wrong.\\\\nTAM calculation is all about making informed assumptions with the data we have in mind\\\\nIn Swati‚Äôs case, she considered the average number of people/ household as 2.5.

Zepto‚Äôs Growth Strategy\\\\nBased on this market & ICP research, we can create a Growth Strategy for Zepto. The growth strategy contains five main levers which are\\\\nAcquisition\\\\nOnboarding\\\\nEngagement & Retention\\\\nMonetisation\\\\nBuilding a Growth Team\\\\nBut all of these levers don‚Äôt mean anything when you don‚Äôt understand the core goal.\\\\nWe have built this growth strategy using the same foundations we teach our members as part of the GrowthX Learning Experience. If you also want to create structured and outcome driven growth model like this for your startup, check out our experience here üí™üèº\\\\nWhat is Zepto‚Äôs goal for the next 2 - 5 years?\\\\nIf you ask us, we definitely have no clue. So that‚Äôs why we are going to hypothesize their goals based on two things\\\\nTheir current growth numbers\\\\nFounder Interviews on YouTube\\\\nLooking at both, one things becomes very clear. One of their current goals is to grow as quickly as possible. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that they don‚Äôt have profitability in mind. They are looking to grow their revenue numbers with the goal of achieving optimal profitability in the next two to five years.\\\\nThey also understand that anyone can copy their business model and quickly overtake them. So their core goal is to also open new dark stores across various markets, establish their presence, gain users & use that as their MOAT!\\\\nIn simple words, you could hypothesise their goal as\\\\n‚Üí Expand to all Tier 1 cities in India and achieve a revenue of XXXX in YYYY number of years\\\\nSince we don‚Äôt have any insider information about Zepto, we‚Äôre just going to assume the revenue number as $500 Million ARR and year as 3. We assume this because Their CEO mentions in one the interviews that they had easily crossed $100 Million ARR a while back.\\\\nSince acquiring new users is going to play a key role, we are going to prioritise Acquisition as our first lever\\\\nSince retaining these users and getting them back is also key to revenue growth & profitabilty, we‚Äôre going to prioritise Engagement & Retention as our second lever\\\\nSince it‚Äôs a mobile app, we need to make sure any user who‚Äôs downloading it, actually ends up using Zepto. We‚Äôre focusing on our Onboarding lever as the third priority\\\\nFinally, we cannot let profitability be an afterthought. It also needs a bit of focus fro the get go. So we‚Äôre going with our Monetisation lever as the fourth priority\\\\nOnce we break down all these levers, we‚Äôll get a very clear idea on how to build our Growth team. Some common questions like\\\\nWho To Hire?\\\\nWhen To Hire?\\\\nBudgets For Hiring?\\\\nWhich are must have roles and good to have roles?\\\\nNOTE: Your growth strategy is not set in stone. Based on the business goals, the market conditions and tons of other factors, your growth strategy will always be evolving. The best growth minds are always aware of this and are willing to tweak their strategies based on the macro and micro changes üöÄ.\\\\n4. Acquisition\\\\nWe have defined 4 different ICPs in the ideal customer section. Each ICP has a different set of needs and different marketing strategies that work for them.\\\\nA really good growth team understand this and will tweak their marketing strategies based on the ICP they‚Äôre trying to reach.\\\\nFor this case, we‚Äôre just going to look at ICP 1 - The ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô. These are folks in the age range of 20 - 25 and purchase everything from online grocery platforms like Instamart, Zepto & BigBasket.\\\\nWe will only create a Growth Model for this ICP. Since they have a lot of unplanned purchases, their usage frequency is also very high. Also because they are young and have a lot of disposable income, their ability & willingness to spend is also high.\\\\nThe most common acquisition channels to reach our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô are\\\\nYou can use the quick links below to jump to any specific section in our Acquisition Lever\\\\nNow let‚Äôs break down all the acquisition levers for Zepto‚Äôs growth model\\\\nOrganic\\\\nZepto‚Äôs organic strategy for the ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô has three splits. This is based on how they discover new products and where they usually spend their time on.\\\\nSearch Engine Optimisation (SEO):\\\\nSEO is the art of ranking your business when your ideal customer searches for it. Since SEO is a pull channel, you need to identify the different ways in which your customers might search for your product\\\\nHere are some common themes we were able to identify with Search Engine Optimisation.\\\\nHere‚Äôs the breakdown with some common examples\\\\nMost of the keywords here were occupied by market leaders like Amazon & BigBasket. Currently Zepto doesn‚Äôt seem to have an SEO strategy in place. It‚Äôs website is also pretty basic, displaying just information information only about their organisation.\\\\nFor starters, their main competitor BigBasket brings around 6.4 million website visitors from smartphone traffic alone. It‚Äôs the ideal time for Zepto to think about organic SEO strategies if they‚Äôre certain about building this for the long term üöÄ\\\\nTo start with SEO, they need to invest in a website strategy that ties in with their app usage. Most of their users will use Zepto on their app. But the website is primarily to build pages and capture the SEO traffic.\\\\nEventually Zepto will also have to build a full scale website like BigBasket if they want to tap into the fullscale SEO potential.\\\\nApp Store Optimisation(ASO):\\\\nSince Zepto is a mobile app first business, App Store & Play Store discovery is a high priority. App Store Optimisation is the art of ranking your app for relevant searches and in the relevant categories.\\\\nASO can also be broken down into the three types of searches, which we have broken down in the Whimsical below\\\\nApart from search, you also need to ensure your app is free from technical glitches and bugs. Pair this with a healthy number of positive reviews, your app will also be displayed in top positions under\\\\nRelated Applications\\\\nTop Free Apps\\\\nTrending Apps\\\\netc..\\\\nYour best bet is to make sure your app\\\\nIs free from technical glitches\\\\nHas an incredible user experience\\\\nTons of Positive Reviews (Possibly 4+ stars)\\\\nSocial Media:\\\\nSocial Media is yet another untapped opportunity for Zepto. One of the reasons we suggest social media is because\\\\nSwiggy, Zomato and a lot of D2C, FMCg brands have been doubling down on Organic social for the same reasons. While it requires constant effort and a lot of experimentation to stay relevant on social, the efforts gradually pay off.\\\\nSince the ‚ÄòYoung Gun‚Äô ICPs are extremely young and spend a lot of time on social media applications, it makes perfect sense ü§òüèº\\\\nThe Social Media strategy would be a mix of long form content (For YouTube etc) and Short form content (for YouTube Shorts & Reels)\\\\nLong Form Content ‚Üí\\\\nThe general theme of long form content is to provide value first. We can start with things ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô might already be searching for. Since some of them might be living alone, some ideas could be\\\\nCooking Tips\\\\nHome Cleaning Tips\\\\nHealthy Eating Tips\\\\netc‚Ä¶.\\\\nShort Form Content ‚Üí\\\\nShort form content should focus on funny anecdotes and things these folks might find relatable.\\\\nFunny Reels\\\\nRelatable Memes\\\\nQuick Informational Videos\\\\netc‚Ä¶.\\\\nHowever considering the entire macro, social media needs to be inclusive of all ICPs. It should not just be relatable to our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô. The overall brand persona and positioning should also be in mind when creating these strategies.\\\\nZepto has had a very heavy reliance on PAID Ads to grow. It is fair given how their business is location dependant and Paid is the best channel for location based targeting.\\\\nSince PAID Ads can be customised and deployed quite quickly, it‚Äôs Time To Value from them is much quicker. Paid Ads can be divided into three sub categories\\\\nThese are advertisements that will be displayed on search engines like Google, Bing and other platforms. The targeting here is based on individual keywords, rather than just interests or demographic data üöÄ\\\\nProduct Ads:\\\\nProduct based ads which focus on specific products can be extremely useful for Zepto. They have two strategies for product base search ads\\\\nProducts that are low AOV, but high margins (fruits, vegetables etc..)\\\\nProducts that are high AOV, but low margin (Oil, Atta etc..)\\\\nProducts that have a high purchase frequency, but low AOV & ROI (Snacks, Quick Munchies)\\\\nWhich products they want to go after is entirely dependant on a strategy backed by data üíΩ\\\\nBrand Ads:\\\\nBrand Ads can be used for keywords where someone is searching for your product, but you don‚Äôt have the sub pages ready for it.\\\\nOr you can also use it to capitalise on the Inbound search terms until SEO kicks in.\\\\nBrand Ads can also be used to kick out competitors for products which Zepto thinks will give them good retention.\\\\nCompetitor Ads:\\\\nThese ads can be run over competitor pages or also be run over products which Zepto‚Äôs competitor‚Äôs are ranking for. Yet again, this can be used to capture a new market, a new product if you think they might help with your retention rates.\\\\nSocial Ads:\\\\nSocial ads come in really handy when you‚Äôre trying to target based on location, interests or both.\\\\nIf Zepto is trying to scale up each individual dark store chronologically, this is a great way to reach customers. You can target based on age, interests, gender & more based on the data platforms given by advertising platforms ü§òüèº\\\\nWe need to be mindful of two things when running social ads\\\\nWhat‚Äôs the key value proposition for this ICP?\\\\nHow do we convert that into our messaging?\\\\nWhich social platforms are they most active in?\\\\nAs we‚Äôre just focusing on the ‚ÄòYoung Gun‚Äô ICP, we also need to make sure the messaging is on point for them. Their messaging can be derived from their Key Value Propositions such as\\\\n10 Min Delivery\\\\nFresh Groceries At Your Doorstep\\\\nSave Time\\\\nHere‚Äôs how a static ad might look for them on a social media platform\\\\nHere‚Äôs an example of a dynamic ad for Zepto.\\\\nIt‚Äôs both quirky and conveys the Key Value Proposition under 15 seconds. Perfect for social media platforms\\\\nWhile running social ads, we also need to mindful of the platforms each ICP is active on. Our ICP is active on Instagram, Snapchat & Facebook which are all good platforms to start with üé¢\\\\nApp Store Ads:\\\\nSince they‚Äôre an app first platform, it makes a lot of sense to prioritise App Store Ads when you‚Äôre starting with the paid channel. The grocery market is a bit mature thanks to old players like BgBasket, Blinkit and other incumbents\\\\nSo it‚Äôs Zepto‚Äôs best bet to capitalise on the existing search volume on these platforms üöÄ\\\\nApp Store Ads can also be of two types as shown below\\\\nThese ad formats are a different beast in themselves. For the sake of keeping this short we are skipping the technicalities in this section for now.\\\\nThere‚Äôs an universal truth we need to understand before we get into Product Integrations. No app, product or business exists out there in Unison. While your customer is using your product, they are also simultaneously using multiple other products at the same time.\\\\nProduct Integration is the concept of seeking a natural fit with the products used by your users and integrating with them.\\\\nBut some ground rules before we seek Product Integrations\\\\nThe Product should not be a direct competitor to Zepto\\\\nThe Product Integration pitch should feel natural and personalised\\\\nThe product should also have good trust (as trust can be destroyed by partnering with a wrong brand)\\\\nThe product should preferably have the same or higher usage frequency than Zepto\\\\nFrom user interviews conducted by GrowthX members, we have discovered that Zepto users also use some products like UrbanClap, Netflix, Hotstar, EatFit etc‚Ä¶\\\\nHere are some interesting product integrations we can work out with the following products\\\\nUrban Company\\\\nHotstar\\\\nEatFit\\\\nThese are just some examples from the top of our head. Once you do more intense customer research, you will be able to find better products that have a better fit with your offerings.\\\\nPartnerships are lesser known ways to get your brand in front of tons of new customers. Zepto can approach partnerships in two different ways\\\\nInfluencer Partnerships\\\\nProduct Placements\\\\nEach has their merit and difference in their payback periods!\\\\nInfluencer Led Partnerships\\\\nThis essentially focuses on partnering with influencers whom your audience are also hooked into. Most of these partnerships are based on behavioural insights which can be derived from customer calls, surveys etc.\\\\nSince we‚Äôre trying to reach the ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô, we will start with the platforms they‚Äôre most active on - IG & YouTube. Step 2 is understanding the themes or which channels/ pages they follow.\\\\nWe know that this persona is focused on improving their career. So a good place to start is with channels that focus on ‚ÄòCareer specific advice‚Äô. Some of them could also be interested in cooking channels üï∫üèº.\\\\nThe main idea is to identify a theme and then double on those specific channels with a solid pitch.\\\\nProduct Placements\\\\nWeb series & movies are a great way to place your products in a subtle manner. The actor sipping on a cold coffee he ordered from Zepto. Or maybe the family member ordering something on Zepto.\\\\nThese are all subtle pitches to place your products in mainstream movies as well as smaller films & web series.\\\\nUnacademy pulled this off incredibly well with their product placements in tv series like Kota Factory, Operation MBBS etc. Product Placements should feel like natural and in sync with the plot. The core idea is to solidify Zepto as a product everyone uses casually in their life.\\\\nOffline ads probably have one of the best product-channel fits for Zepto because of their hyperlocal nature. When done right, this channel can solve for discovery for a very specific set of ICPs in one location. The best ICP to start with is our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô\\\\nHere are a couple of offline channel ideas to target ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô in their daily life\\\\nThey mostly take an Ola or Uber to reach their workplace\\\\nWe can place ads in autos & cabs behind the driver‚Äôs seat\\\\nThey might take a bus or the use the metro train\\\\nWe can also place banners in specially designated boards at these stops\\\\nThey will use the lift atleast twice a day in their office space\\\\nWe can place an ad inside the lift walls\\\\nThey will walk past the lobby in their office space (preferably an IT park)\\\\nWe can place custom booths that encourage people to download and try Zepto\\\\nOffline channels come in a variety of ways and help us target folks in a very specific locality!\\\\nFor most consumer led applications, referrals can be an incredible acquisition tool. Since our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô are highly social and tech savvy, referral can have a good product market fit for them.\\\\nAll good referral programs will nail 4 things in depth\\\\nThe reward for both the referrer and the referee\\\\nWhy will someone refer?\\\\nWhen will someone refer?\\\\nHow easy it is to refer?\\\\nEach section can use a separate page in reality. But for this guide, we‚Äôre going to focus on Zepto and our target ICP - ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô.\\\\nWhy will someone refer Zepto?\\\\nAt the heart of every successful referral program lies an incredible customer experience. The best reason someone will refer Zepto is when they have a great experience with it. A great experience is delivered when\\\\nThey get their order in under 15 minutes\\\\nThe items are fresh and undamaged\\\\nThe packaging is good\\\\nThey get exactly what they ordered for (not something different - happens frequently in grocery delivery apps)\\\\nTheir AOV of each order is high (Depth)\\\\nThey keep ordering multiple times a week (frequency)\\\\nThe idea here is to identify when someone has a good experience and then take them to the referral loop\\\\nWhen will someone refer Zepto?\\\\nThe discovery of the referral loop should always be placed in the ‚ÄòHappy Flow‚Äô of the customer.\\\\nSome examples of happy flows are\\\\nAfter a customer receives their order in under 15 minutes\\\\nAfter a customer has submitted a review\\\\nThe goal is to identify screens where the user is in a ‚ÄòHappy Flow‚Äô yet it still won‚Äôt hinder the primary goal (complete an order)\\\\nWhat is the reward?\\\\nA good reward does two things\\\\nEnables the customer to keep referring\\\\nEnables the new customers to & old customers to keep using the app\\\\nIn that frame of mind, rewards should be app specific and increase the usage of the app. Monetary rewards are good, but they prevent the users from investing the reward back into the app.\\\\nApp specific coins, coupons and dicsounts are always good currencies for a referral system. One such reward is Zepto‚Äôs ‚ÄòZepto cash‚Äô. It provides both the referrer and the referee with credits they can only use in Zepto.\\\\nHow easy is it to refer?\\\\nEase of a referral system depends on two things\\\\nDiscovery of the referral system\\\\nAbility to Track your referrals\\\\nDiscovery can be solved by showing the referral link in all the ‚ÄòHappy Flows‚Äô and also on the sidebar.\\\\nAbility to track referrals is important because it allows the referrer to understand where his referees are\\\\nHave they clicked on the link\\\\nHave the downloaded the app\\\\nHave they made their first transaction\\\\nBut building a referral program like this is resource intensive and takes up a lot of development effort (even with the use of tools!)\\\\nA good idea is to run a test to a small population before deploying it to tons of users. Some things that can be tested are\\\\nRewards for referee\\\\nRewards for referrer\\\\nPlacement of the referral link\\\\nTracking of the referral link\\\\nDifferent ways to share the referral link\\\\nHere are some metrics Zepto can track to ensure the success of it‚Äôs referral program\\\\nNumber of active users sending invites\\\\nNumber of invites per referrer\\\\nConversion rate to link clicks\\\\nConversion rate to app downloads\\\\nConversion rate to first purchase\\\\nConversion rate to first review\\\\nSo that‚Äôs all about the acquisiton strategies for Zepto ü§òüèº. Now let‚Äôs take a look into the next most important lever for Zepto‚Äôs success - E&R.\\\\nEngagement & Retention are the holy grail of building a successful product in any market. We could even go further and say, Engagement & Retention are the pillars of any successful business.\\\\nGood engagement leads to better retention.\\\\nBetter retention leads to revenue and word of mouth.\\\\nGood revenue means you can invest in the best talent, improve the product even more and rule the market\\\\nWord of mouth means that you can now acquire customers at costs that keep getting lower\\\\nAll these combine into a vicious cycle which make any product/ business successful.\\\\nWhere does retention come here?\\\\nSome of the best product teams think about retention right from the Onboarding. It‚Äôs all about helping the user become powerful with the product. Retention is never an afterthought in any successful product. When done right, retention can drive product & even business decisions.\\\\nHow does Engagement & Retention apply to our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nBefore we even dive into the engagement framework for our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô, we need to understand some basic terms üëáüèº\\\\nFrequency of usage - Number of times someones orders from Zepto\\\\nDepth - No of items ordered in each category (Tomato, Onion, Potato under the vegetables section)\\\\nBreadth - No of categories ordered (1 Vegetable, 2 fruits, 1 Bread, 1 oil etc..)\\\\nThese are the 3 pillars of good engagement.\\\\nBased on these pillars we can define users into 3 buckets üëáüèº\\\\nCasual - People who order from Zepto once a week - once every two weeks\\\\nCore - People who order from Zepto two to three times a week\\\\nPower - People who order from Zepto 4+ times a week\\\\nWe are yet again going to pull excerpts from Aadeesh Deshpande‚Äôs (GX12) assignment on Zepto to deep dive into our framework.\\\\nThere are three types of buying habits for Zepto‚Äôs users üëáüèº\\\\nStock Up - Plan & buy groceries for the entire week\\\\nTop Up - Buying items that generally have a low shelf life (Vegetables, fruits, bread, milk etc.)\\\\nUnplanned Purchases - Items that might have run out without knowledge or items that have a sudden need (Oil, masala powders, Alcohol, Snacks etc..)\\\\nHere are some facts we know about our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô from the table we‚Äôve added above\\\\nCharacteristics\\\\nPotential ICP 1\\\\nName\\\\nYoung Guns\\\\nAge\\\\n21 - 26\\\\nIncome\\\\n8 lakhs/ annum+\\\\nRelationship Status\\\\n‚Üí Unmarried\\\\n‚Üí Sometimes in a relationship\\\\nEmployment Status/ Work Experience\\\\n‚Üí Freshly Employed\\\\nCity\\\\nTier 1\\\\nTech Savvy\\\\nYES\\\\nFrequently Used Social Media Apps\\\\nLinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram\\\\nEntertainment Services Used\\\\nDisney+ Hostar, Zee5, Amazon Prime\\\\nEcommerce services used\\\\nBookMyShow, Amazon, Myntra, Nykaa, Swiggy, Zomato, Zepto, Urban Company\\\\nIncome Spent On\\\\n1.

Late Night\\\\nCustomer AOV\\\\nVery High\\\\nAbility To Spend\\\\nVery High\\\\nShift Needed to Spend on Zepto\\\\nNo Shift Needed\\\\nWe know that they rarely stock up on their daily needs. Most of their purchases are last minute and unplanned. We also know that this segment has a ton of disposable income and has a very low barrier of entry to Zepto.\\\\nWe also know that the majority of this segment live in a Tier 1 city which is where Zepto primarily operates. In his research, Aadeesh has quoted a research paper from Redseer which indicates that 70% of all grocery purchases are a mix of unplanned & top-up puchases.\\\\nSo what‚Äôs the engagement campaign for ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nTitle\\\\nContent\\\\nUnderstanding\\\\nWe know that a ton of Young Guns order from Zepto 2 - 3 times a week. But this is only fruits, vegetables & some quick perishables.\\\\nType of user\\\\nAt the moment they are core users\\\\nGoal of the campaign\\\\nGet them to order from other categories like Snacks, Juices, Cleaning Essentials, Electricals etc‚Ä¶\\\\nWe want to eventually increase the breadth of the user and convert them into a power users\\\\nExperiments To Run\\\\n1.

But all this experimentation needs to be tracked to understand if it‚Äôs a success or not.\\\\nItem\\\\nContent\\\\nMetrics To Track\\\\n1. No of new categories ordered\\\\n2. Cart Size\\\\n3.

Garam Masala\\\\n2. Curd\\\\n3. Ready to eat Chapatti\\\\n4. Cashew nuts\\\\n5. Desserts (if it‚Äôs dinner)\\\\nWhat does Retention look like for ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nFor Zepto, the best retention happens with both depth (more items in one category) and breadth (ordering from multiple categories). Once they start ordering different items, Zepto becomes the go to place for our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô.\\\\nIncreasing Depth and Breadth makes Zepto their Go-To product which naturally increases their frequency of usage.\\\\nWhich channels drive the best retention for ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nTimely Push Notifications:\\\\nPush Notifications that are backed up data is a great option. Let‚Äôs say one person orders a packet of milk every two days at exactly 9 PM. If they haven‚Äôt ordered milk for the last two days, a push notification asking them to order milk can go out ‚úåüèº\\\\nWhatsApp Notifications:\\\\nWhatsApp notifications can also be triggered as reminders for them.\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume that their favourite milkshake brand was out of stock in their last order. We can run a WhatsApp notification to tell them it‚Äôs back in stock\\\\nLet‚Äôs assume the milk example. We can push a WhatsApp notification to remind them\\\\nSlack or Teams Notifications\\\\nThis is a bit contradictory. But we know that ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô are heavily career focused. So there‚Äôs a very high chance that they may be using an internal communication tool like Slack or Microsoft Teams.\\\\nA quick growth test can be to connect their Slack IDs and send them reminders through them. Although be wary as this is just an hypothesis and hasn‚Äôt been proven by any grocery delivery startup yet!\\\\nWhich Products/ Categories drive the best retention?\\\\nQuick Perishable Items like Milk, Eggs, Bread, Fruits & Vegetables (High freq & high margin)\\\\nFlour, Oil, Rice items\\\\nBathroom & home cleaning equipments\\\\nBath, Body & Hygiene products\\\\nIndulgence items like Biscuits, Chips, Cold drinks, Ice cream etc..\\\\nFinally, why would ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô churn?\\\\nChurn can be divided into two types at the very basic level - Voluntary & Involuntary. Once you understand the reasons someone might churn, your team can work on preventing them. An acute understanding of the reasons can also help you fix issues in your marketing & brand perception\\\\nVoluntary Reasons For Churn\\\\nDelivery Time is too long\\\\nWrong Items were delivered\\\\nItems were delivered to the wrong address\\\\nProducts were damaged during delivery\\\\nExpired products were delivered\\\\nHigh delivery fee\\\\nProducts were out of stock\\\\nInvoluntary Reasons For Churn\\\\nShifted to a new location where Zepto is not available\\\\nOut of town for sometime\\\\nIssue with certain payment portals\\\\nAs you start mapping out all the potential reasons someone might churn, you can trace it back to early signs of churn. For example, if delivery time for a certain user has increased and you see a drop in their frequency, there might be some level of causation at play.\\\\nNegative actions to keep an eye on\\\\nDrop in App Open Rate\\\\nA lot of customer support tickets\\\\nDrop in the frequency of orders\\\\nDrop in basket value\\\\nDrop in weekly/ monthly AOV\\\\nIncrease in Cart Abandonment\\\\nA key concept you should keep in mind. There is a very good difference between causation and correlation.\\\\nIf order frequency is going down while delivery time increases, there is a high chance of relation between the two. But there is also a good chance that there‚Äôs no relation between the two.\\\\nMaybe they had a roommate who just moved out. Hence their order frequency is low\\\\nMaybe they started buying their fruits and vegetables from a street vendor because that was easy\\\\nAs a growth person, before you jump into any conclusions, you need to do the due diligence to understand the reason. You can do this by\\\\nSending a survey,\\\\nLooking at their support tickets\\\\nLooking at the change in items orders before & after change of freq\\\\nScheduling a 1:1 calls with your users\\\\n& more..\\\\nAs a growth person, your goal should be to seek the truth before you confirm your hypotheses.\\\\nWhat are some retention campaigns we can run for our ‚ÄòYoung Guns‚Äô?\\\\nThis is an example we‚Äôve pulled out from Aadeesh Deshpande‚Äôs assignment on Zepto. We‚Äôre just tweaking a bunch of the ideas for better presentation.\\\\nConcept\\\\nCampaign Details\\\\nTarget Segment\\\\nCore & Power Users\\\\nTarget ICP\\\\nYoung Guns\\\\nPurchase Behaviour For Core Users\\\\n‚Üí Top Ups and last minute unplanned purchases\\\\n‚Üí Mostly fruits, vegetables, groceries & household items\\\\n‚Üí 5+ products in cart\\\\n‚Üí 3 times a week minimum\\\\nPurchase Behaviour For Power Users\\\\n‚Üí All Categories\\\\n‚Üí 2 to 10 products in cart\\\\n‚Üí 5+ times a week minimum\\\\nGoal\\\\nResurrect Core & Power Users\\\\nCampaign Targeting\\\\nFrequency of orders has reduced.\\\\nReason: Increase in Delivery Time\\\\nProposed Solution\\\\nApologise for the delayed delivery time and compensate with Zepto coins!\\\\nPitch/ Content\\\\nPush Notification on app/ WhatsApp Notification\\\\nWe understand that your time is money.\\\\n3 out of your last 5 deliveries were delayed by more than 15 minutes. Please do accept our apologies in the form on 150 Zepto coins!\\\\nFrequency & Timing of Campaign\\\\nThe notification should be sent one week after the last order. A reminder needs to be sent 15 days after if the user is still not resurrected!\\\\nSuccess Metrics\\\\n‚Üí % of users displaying old purchase frequency after 8 weeks\\\\n‚Üí WOW Retention curve\\\\nOther Micro Metrics To Track\\\\n‚Üí App Notification to Click Ratio\\\\n‚Üí Click to ‚ÄòAdd to cart‚Äô ratio\\\\nReasons this campaign will work\\\\n‚Üí By accepting the honest mistake and offering a reward, the core & power users will be happy to come back\\\\n‚Üí The Zepto coins will further incentivise them to give another chance to Zepto!\\\\nAssociated Risks\\\\n‚Üí If the order is delayed again, user may lose trust in the brand & may never come back again\\\\n‚Üí They may be further offended that we are trying to bring them back with cash incentives\\\\nYou can use the same framework to create multiple resurrection campaigns for all types of users. This level of depth will help you prioritise segments in a massive product like Zepto.\\\\nThe same framework can be used for all other voluntary and involuntary churn. As a growth person, your first priority is to understand the reasons and prioritise the solutions on the cohorts which will have the maximum impact.\\\\n6. Onboarding\\\\nSince we‚Äôve prioritised acquisition and engagement & Retention, we‚Äôre not going to focus on the other two levers on this guide. The superpower every growth person must have is the ability to say ‚ÄòNO‚Äô and prioritise with laser focus.\\\\nEven if you have infinite resources to handle, you need to have focus. Focus will help you solve the most important problems effectively. Moreover focus will help you reach your revenue goals effectively!\\\\nBut if you were to work on the Onboarding lever, here are some metrics you could track\\\\nDownload Metrics\\\\nAdd to basket metrics\\\\nCheckout metrics\\\\n‚Üí Channel wise download metrics:\\\\nAds to Downloads\\\\nFacebook ads to app download\\\\nIG Ads to app download\\\\nOrganic to download\\\\nGoogle search to download\\\\nGoogle play store search to download\\\\nApp store search to download\\\\n‚Üí Add to basket metrics:\\\\nNumber of download to registration\\\\nNumber of registrations to ‚ÄòVisited Homepage‚Äô\\\\nNumber of ‚ÄòVisited Homepage‚Äô to ‚ÄòAdd Items to cart‚Äô\\\\nNumber of ‚ÄòAdd Items to cart‚Äô to ‚ÄòVisited Checkout Page‚Äô\\\\n‚Üí Checkout Metrics:\\\\nNumber of items added to cart\\\\nNumber of categories added to cart\\\\nAverage order value\\\\nNumber of users checked out out with COD\\\\nNumber of users checked out with Credit Cards\\\\nNumber of users checked out with UPI\\\\n‚Üí All these metrics can also be further divided into\\\\nDevice\\\\nPlatform\\\\nAcquisition channel\\\\nDark Store\\\\nGeographical Location\\\\nTime\\\\netc‚Ä¶\\\\nThis is a very broad list of metrics you can track to understand your users. As always the metrics you choose will be dependant on your current revenue goals and business priorities.\\\\n7. Monetisation\\\\nFinally, the most important, yet looked upon growth lever is the monetisation lever. Revenue should never be an afterthought for any business. Since this lever is also not a priority at the moment, we are not going to deep dive into it.\\\\nEven before you work on your monetisation lever, you have to run the ‚ÄòLitmus Test‚Äô to understand your retention. Monetisation only works if atleast a certain subset of your users retain after a certain period of time.\\\\nOnce the litmus test is cleared, the monetisation lever has four categories\\\\nWho to charge?\\\\nWhen to charge?\\\\nWhat to charge?\\\\nHow much to charge?\\\\nand that‚Äôs all about the Growth levers for Zepto.\\\\nüí°\\\\nBy the way, the depth you see here is just a feeler of the depth we teach at GrowthX üí´\\\\nGrowthX is an invite-only club of over 3000 members who are product, marketing, and business leaders, and founders from top internet-first companies like Google, Canva, CRED, Stripe, Netflix, and more üíé\\\\nWe teach our members how to scale revenues via frameworks that can be applied starting next Monday morning.

Why is Zepto well positioned to win?\\\\nZepto has grown at breakneck speeds and we truly believe that can win in the long term. Here are some reasons why\\\\n1. Huge market that‚Äôs growing exponentially:\\\\nThe Indian economy is growing at an exponential pace. What happened in the west 20 years back is happening in India currently. As more capital is being poured into the country, new businesses are being formed every day. This leads to a surplus of capital in the economy.\\\\nCapital that can be used to deploy to make you life easier, like buy groceries from Zepto, instead of going to a shop nearby.\\\\nThe picture below shows an estimate of how the Indian economy will grow in the next 25 years.\\\\nThis is the macro shift that BigBasket definitely missed in its formative years.\\\\n2. Customer trust with internet products is growing exponentially:\\\\nThe Indian consumer segment are slowly starting to understand and trust internet products. Before Ola, Flipkart, Myntra and other startups came into play, spending money on the internet was a challenge. And it was not because of the lack of money\\\\nPeople still had disposable income, but the trust levels were quite low. No one were accustomed to spending money on these consumer apps.\\\\nThe advent of internet apps, paired with JIO and UPI changed this game.\\\\nSpending money on the internet became an everyday thing and this naturally improved the trust levels of consumers. Zepto is well positioned at a time where consumer trust on these internet startups is growing exponentially.\\\\n3. Backed by an experienced leadership team:\\\\nThere‚Äôs a reason why Zepto went from zero to 2000+ employees in a matter of two years. Right from the get go, the founders were keen on hiring experienced leader for their management team.\\\\nThey hired folks who had already done that startup journey in the same or a related field. Some of their most senior hires were\\\\nTheir CFO, Jitendra N was already a VP of Finance at Pharmeasy\\\\nTheir CBO, Viral Jhaveri had worked leadership roles in Uber Eats and FreighTigers\\\\nTheir People function is headed by Roma Bindroo handled the people function at Johnson & Johnson for multiple years\\\\nThe founders understood that Zepto is still an operations heavy business with some software at the front. Even if they make the software 100x better, the operations cannot be avoided.\\\\nThey understood the game and started hiring folks who understood operations heavy businesses in the first place. This allowed them to reduce mistakes and scale faster than ever!\\\\nüöÄ\\\\nIf you‚Äôre a leader or a founder, keen to hire the Top 1% Growth Talent in India, do register to our waiting list here.

Changing customer behaviour:\\\\nWith the boom of the economy, customer behaviour is also changing constantly. More customers are now starting to value Convenience >> Money.\\\\nStartups like Swiggy, Uber, Urban Company are a true testament to this!\\\\n5. High driver retention rate:\\\\nZepto has a 7% higher delivery driver retention rate than all hyperlocal delivery startups in India. This is because of a couple of reasons\\\\nZero long distance deliveries - Drivers hate nothing more than long distance deliveries\\\\nA centralised hub for all drivers - Since Zepto operates only out of dark stores, this gives them a chance to provide a designated waiting area for delivery partners. The founder mentioned that they also provide their partners with water, snacks & otehr condiments to make their life easier.\\\\nWhile 7% maybe a marginal amount, it can eventually add up. Driver experience is a key piece in winning this hyperlocal war. Since there is no penalty or drivers when they jump ships, the player who retains the most, eventually wins in the long term.\\\\n6. High NPS:\\\\nZepto was founded on the core insight of high NPS from the days of Kiranakart (their old startup). Basically customers who received their orders in less than 15 minutes had a higher NPS compared to customers who got it later.\\\\nSince Zepto is built on this core insight, their NPS is close to 80% (which is spectacular)\\\\n7. High Customer Retention rate:\\\\nYet again, during the days of Kiranakart, the founders realised that customers who recieved orders in less than 15 minutes retained better. The 15 min delivery is a WOW factor, around which Zepto is entirely built out of.\\\\nThis helps them own a retention rate of 60% even with 2 million+ customers & growing!\\\\n8. Wave 2 startups FTW:\\\\nWave 1 startups are the BigBaskets and Flipkarts of India. They faced a lot of challenges in terms of the MACRO\\\\nTalent\\\\nEconomical Growth\\\\nConsumer Trust\\\\nPayments\\\\nConsumer Sentiment etc\\\\nIn the last 10 years however, the entire Macro of India has shifted in favour of startups üëáüèº\\\\nThe talent pool has become denser (lots of people who have been there and done that)\\\\nThe economy has grown and is growing by leaps and bounds\\\\nThe people have more trust on Internet startups\\\\nPaying for something has become incredibly easier (thanks to UPI and all the Fintech startups)\\\\nConsumer have started spending more money rather than just saving it\\\\n9. They have solved for delivery accuracy:\\\\nA big challenge with old age grocery delivery startups is order accuracy. Issues like missing some items or even delivering the wrong items is terrible customer experience. The customer on the other end orders grocieries for convenience. Missed or wrong deliveries is probably the most inconvenient thing for them.\\\\nThe founding team developed Zepto with a razer focus of delivering the right order on time. The pay close attention to the dispatch process and fill any leaks to prevent wrong deliveries.\\\\nOther incumbents like Swiggy Instamart, BigBasket have also fixed this in the recent days. Should be interesting to see how they fare against Zepto in the future.\\\\n10. Expanding to new locations:\\\\nZepto‚Äôs founder mentioned in an interview is doubling in business every three months. This is possible because of their rapid expansion to new locations with a ton of darkstores. Since their inception, Zepto has grown from one store in Mumbai to 75+ locations across Bangalore, Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata and other tier 1 metro cities.\\\\nThis has been possible because of an experienced management team and high focus on creating formalised processes for everything!\\\\n11. Expanding to different categories:\\\\nZepto started with just groceries, but now they‚Äôve expanded to beauty accessories, baby products and even electronics. As they slowly figure out the supply chain and formulate the entire process, they can add more categories to this. An example could be umbrellas & raincoats during monsoon.\\\\nThe sky is the limit when they have the supply chain figured out for everything.\\\\n12. Execution On Point:\\\\nGrocery delivery is not a huge innovation. BigBasket and many other incumbents have already done it and grown massively. Even the 15 min delivery can be figured out by other players in a matter of time.\\\\nThe biggest strength of team Zepto is their ability to execute. Momentum is a very sneaky element that exponentially increases your success.\\\\nWhile other players are changing their business model to fit the 10 min delivery, Zepto is already acing it. The first mover advantage alone will carry them far above the finish line. By providing an incredible service, they can retain to all their customers while other incumbents are still building for the market.\\\\n5. What are the reasons Zepto might also lose in the hyper competitive grocery space?\\\\nThere are always two sides to any coin. If there are a couple of reasons why Zepto will win, there are even more reasons as to why it might lose. We wouldn‚Äôt do justice to this guide without looking at those points too!\\\\n1. Expanding to Tier 2 cities will be a challenge:\\\\nTier 1 cities currently contribute to almost the entire revenue of Zepto. Last time we checked, there were no Zepto owned darkstores in tier 2+ cities. Zepto will reach a plateau as they expand across all tier 1 cities.\\\\nThey can only unlock even more growth when they reach tier 2 cities. However tier 2+ cities are built different in terms of\\\\nPopulation distribution\\\\nMindset\\\\nCustomer sentiment\\\\nBuilding Zepto for tier 2+ cities will require a whole different mindset that the current model. They will have to rethink everything which will require time & a lot of money.\\\\n2. Not all dark stores will be profitable:\\\\nThe cold truth is that not all darkstores will be profitable. Power laws can be crazy in business and a small percentage of the dark stores may end up generating the most amount of revenue.\\\\nThe hard part about this is each darkstore, irrespective of revenue will have a fixed operating cost. This will be split between\\\\nSalaries\\\\nRent\\\\nOther bills\\\\nSo at some point Zepto will have to decide between closing low revenue locations or keeping them alive for just overall brand visibility.\\\\n3. White-labelling products is an operational challenge:\\\\nThere is only so much you can earn from selling other brands. That‚Äôs exactly why so many supermarkets end up creating their own products like rice, oil, bread etc..\\\\nIt allows them to control the supply chain and take a bigger share of the revenue pie.\\\\nHowever producing your own products is also investment heavy. While production is the first challenge, Quality Control & Branding is an even bigger challenge. Acquisitions can come in handy for this play.\\\\nWe‚Äôll just have to wait and see how Zepto play this card out!\\\\n4. Free Delivery might hit on the margins:\\\\nWhile ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô is great for the growth stage, it is not sustainable for overall sustenance. At some point, Zepto will have to cut down on ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô. Or they might also need to increase the minimum threshold for ‚ÄòFree Delivery‚Äô.\\\\nThis might lead to a drop in order frequency and users jumping to competitor products who do offer ‚Äò Free Delivery‚Äô.\\\\n5. Zero Cost Of Switching:\\\\nThe biggest problem with hyperlocal startups like this is the switching cost. Or should we say that there isn‚Äôt say.\\\\nWhat is a switching cost?\\\\nIt is the cost a customer has to pay when they decide to use another application. For example, when someone decided to use another SaaS app, the switching cost is loss of data. If they decide to play another game, they will end up losing all their progress and having to start from scratch.\\\\nEssentially, switching cost is a hidden cost that prevents a customer from using another app.\\\\nSince there is ‚ÄòZero Switching Costs‚Äô customer can have all of their competeitors on the phone and order from anyone of required. If they get one or two bad experiences, they might immediately jump to a competeitor.\\\\nIf BigBasket can also consistently deliver in under 15 minutes, Zepto is no longer a ‚Äòmust-have‚Äô but a ‚ÄòGood to have‚Äô.\\\\n6. 10 min model is replicable:\\\\nOne big IP risk is that their min model is incredible 10 in delivery can be implemented by anyone. All they need is some capital to frontload their darkstore and they‚Äôre good to go. To Retain customers in the long run, Zepto will have to keep providing on their promise of quick delivery.\\\\n7. Change in government regulations:\\\\nA lot of things need to go right for internet startups to succeed in India. Once such thing are the government regulations. As of now, Zepto can classify their drivers as partners and not employees. This allows them to pay their drivers like a consultant rather than an employee.\\\\nThis also includes all drivers who operate with Swiggy, Zomato and other delivery partners.\\\\nIf one day, the government mandates that they should also be treated as employees, it will mess with their entire P&L and might even sink the business.\\\\n8. Lose out on the waiting game\\\\nThe team behind is executing well, but can they maintain it for the long term. Old players like BigBasket are flush with an instream of capital from the TATA group. While Zepto is dependant on investor money to stay afloat. Sure, most of their darkstores eventually ramp up and start earning revenue.\\\\nBut what if players like BigBasket decide to cut Zepto on delivery costs & margins?\\\\nThis will be a long game where Zepto can only win if they are fiscally discipline and provide a stellar experience.\\\\nThese are some of the reasons we think Zepto might fail in the next 2 - 5 years.\\\\nHowever no one can predict the future and these are all just speculations up to this point. But as a growth and business person, it is your job to constantly speculate, hypothesise and play the devil‚Äôs advocate to future proof your business.\\\\nWe hope you enjoyed reading this blog.\\\\nüöÄ\\\\nIf you have any feedback, please do leave them in the TypeForm here.

Well, they are \\\\nnot newbies in the start -up world, this is their third start -up after GoPool and Kiranakart.  They came with \\\\nthis ground-breaking idea while sitting in their homes and waiting for their groceries to be delivered in 2 -3 \\\\ndays. Zepto belongs to those start -up subgroups that experienced meteoric development in the post -\\\\nCovid period. This case explains the developme nt process of how the company is making it possible to \\\\ndeliver items in 10 minutes. Zepto has raised $360 million in funding with the lead investors being the \\\\nAmerican start up accelerator company Y Combinator and the American growth equity firm Glade Broo k \\\\nCapital Partners. Currently, the company has a valuation of $900 million. 1 So, the possibility that Zepto  \\\\nwill soon turn into a unicorn is not a daft idea. However, there is a major concern surrounding Zepto‚Äô s \\\\nbusiness model as they have still not made the business profitable. Zepto is also facing tough \\\\ncompetition from its rival Blinkit (formerly known as Grofers) who was founded in December 2013. \\\\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\\\n \\\\nKeywords: Zepto, Start-up, E-commerce, Business Model, Post-Covid. \\\\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\\\n \\\\nIntroduction \\\\n Zepto is a quick e-commerce company that started its operations in 2021. \\\\n The company started its operations in Bandra, Mumbai and has subsequently extended its \\\\ndelivery areas to Pune, Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Ghaziabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata. \\\\n On October 31, 2021, a total of 8 investors, led by Glade Brook Capital Partners, invested in \\\\nthem $60 million after which more investors began to notice them. Later, they raised additional funding \\\\nthrough their series C and series D rounds. Y Combinator Continuity Fund became the major investor in \\\\nboth of these rounds. \\\\n The Series C and D rounds were held on December 20, 2021 and May 2, 2022 and raised $100 \\\\nmillion and $200 million respectively2.But Zepto is not the only quick commerce start-up that is backed by \\\\nstrong funding, it is up against fierce competition in India from Blinkit. Blinkit has received backing from \\\\n24 investor s and has gone through a total of 19 fundraising rounds. Blinkit is currently valued at $1 \\\\nbillion3. And then there is also Dunzo which is backed by Google. \\\\nZepto‚Äô s tagline is \"Groceries delivered in 10 minutes‚Äù. They do this with the help of Dark stores . \\\\nThey are nothing but warehouses that are not open to the public and are located in such area in the \\\\nneighbourhood where demand is high.Only commonly requested commodities are kept in these \\\\nwarehouses, preventing the loss of unsold stock. Zepto‚Äô s dark st ores are designed in a way so that \\\\norders are filled as rapidly as possible, effectively and efficiently reducing time. Currently, Zepto is \\\\ndelivering 2500+ goods, including food and drink, personal care products, fresh produce, home cleaning \\\\nsupplies, and  snacks and beverages, from its 100+ dark stores. As stated by the CEO of zepto  Aadit \\\\nPalicha the average delivery time taken by Zepto is 8 minutes and 47 seconds. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf02a Supervisor, Mentor &Associate Professor, Department of Commerce, Daulat Ram College, University of \\\\nDelhi, Delhi, India. \\\\n**  Student pursuing B.

The company uses artificial intelligence (AI) t o \\\\nenhance the effectiveness of its delivery network by taking into account variables like weather, traffic \\\\npatterns, population, geography, and the availability of last-mile supplies. \\\\n The co-founders have managed to make the roots of the company strong by  getting the best \\\\ntalent out there to work for them when they first started building a team.  They were successful in \\\\npersuading a number of high-profile executives from Dream 11, Amazon, Uber, Pharmeasy, and Flipkart. \\\\n(Source: LinkedIn) \\\\nThese qualified exe cutives have assisted Zepto in achieving unit economics and capital \\\\nefficiency. They are what have allowed Zepto to carve out a place for itself in the grocery‚Äôs delivery \\\\nmarket. \\\\nFindings  \\\\nGroceries account for the majority of India\\\\\\'s $1 trillion retail market.1 Consequently, this market \\\\nhas enormous potential. During Corona, it was challenging to leave the house every time you wanted to \\\\nbuy a small essential item, and today with people having to work for long hours, especially in urban cities, \\\\nit is challenging to go out and shop for daily groceries. The market needed an app like Zepto more than it \\\\nwanted one, thus its release was ideal. These apps help customers to save their time  and make their life \\\\neasier. As of right now, as mentioned by the C EO of zepto, they receive 100,000 orders each day, and \\\\ntheir demand curve is essentially flat. They once more turn to technology to determine the ideal location \\\\nfor their tiny fulfilment centres. \\\\nAlthough some would believe that Zepto‚Äô s delivery speed is what sets them apart from the \\\\ncompetition, this is not the case. The key element that sets zepto apart from its rivals is not the quickness \\\\nof the delivery men, but rather how effectively it uses technology. Zepto tracks its customers\\\\\\' spatial data, \\\\ntraffic dynamics, the time it takes to deliver the items, etc. with the aid of www.locus.sh. They collect this \\\\ndata and analyse it to decide whether they need more dark stores in the area to be able to achieve that \\\\n10-minute goal. \\\\nZepto Generates Income in Two Ways \\\\n‚Ä¢ It first negotiates a profit margin with the companies based on how much of their product is kept \\\\nin the warehouse. \\\\n‚Ä¢ Second, they make money by charging companies for ad space and the top search results. \\\\n‚Ä¢ Zepto had total revenue of INR 142.3 Cr in FY22, while incurring costs of INR 532.7 Cr. They \\\\nsuffered a loss of 390.3 Cr INR as a result. \\\\nMarketing costs make up the majority of their spending \\\\nThey invest a lot of money in promoting and advertising their app. During FY22, they spent INR \\\\n175.5 Cr, or almo st 33% of their overall expenses on marketing. In addition to this, the firm spent INR \\\\n213.2 Cr on stock -in-trade purchases in FY22. Employee benefits cost INR 50.3 Cr, while supply chain \\\\ncosts were INR 74 Cr.2 \\\\nZepto‚Äô s EBITDA margin in FY22 was -259.39%.3An EBITDA offers a clear picture of the \\\\ncompany\\\\\\'s worth and displays it to potential buyers and investors. Unfortunately, Zepto‚Äô s EBITDA is \\\\nnegative. \\\\n To distribute the products, Zepto utilizes gig workers. These individuals make an average \\\\nincome of INR 1,30,211.4 \\\\n Zepto has been able to outperform the competition because of its business model. They have a \\\\nhighly effective distribution system, and Zepto‚Äô s AI-powered tools make it simple to manage and keep an \\\\neye on inventory and product selection. This leads to better in ventory management and a wider range of \\\\nproducts. Additionally, they have a large consumer base that is constantly growing. \\\\n \\\\n1  https://www.statista.com/statistics/1021352/india-organized-retail-market-value/https://www.statista.com/topics/5615/food-retail-in \\\\nindia/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20the%20food%20and%20grocery,retail%20market%20at%2063%20percent . \\\\n2  https://www.vccircle.com/zeptounlikely-to-turn-profitable-in-near-term \\\\n3  https://inc42.com/buzz/zepto-incurs-inr-390-cr-loss-in-first-year-of-operations-fy22-sales-at-inr-\\\\n141r/#:~:text=Zepto%2C%20which%20began%20operations%20in,stood%20at%20INR%20140.7%20Cr . \\\\n4  https://www.ambitionbox.com/salaries/zepto-salaries/delivery-boy \\\\x0cDr. Sunita Gupta & Avani Pandey: Just in 10 Minutes: A Case Study on Zepto 195 \\\\nDiscussion \\\\n Zepto is indeed facing losses but it is only natural for a fledgling enterprise in their early years of \\\\noperations to incur some loss.  While Zepto has suffered losses, it is still in a better situation than Blinkit \\\\nand Dunzo, which have suffered losses of INR 1,019 Cr and INR 464 Cr respectively.1 \\\\nThe quick commerce industry has a customer base that is not very devoted, s o even if delivery \\\\ntime increases by a few minutes, customers will still go where they can obtain the best deals. \\\\n Zepto has to strike a balance between discounts and deals and keep their delivery time between \\\\n10 and 20 minutes. Blinkit is their sole main rival at the moment in this market. They need to start \\\\npenetrating into newer cities if they want to distinctly emerge as the leaders of quick commerce. \\\\nZepto has to diversify its revenue streams and stop relying solely on a limited range of sources. \\\\nAccording to the founders of Zepto, they are planning to open a Zepto caf√© that will provide popular \\\\nbrand‚Äôs coffee and tea. If it were to become a reality, it may  be successful since metropolitan city\\\\\\'s youth \\\\nrun on caffeine, and hitting up chaayos or blue tokaievery time you feel like drinking one is impractical. If \\\\nZepto wants to make this business a success, they will need more funding. Since Zepto has already \\\\nestablished a reputation for itself and everything associated with that name would benefit from its \\\\ngoodwill, their marketing costs shouldn\\\\\\'t be too high. \\\\nZepto, as well as any other rapid commerce start -up, solely receives criticism for how it treats \\\\ndelivery guys. Due to the shorter time constraints these workers must adhere to, they may drive rashly, \\\\nincreasing the chances of accidents.  Zepto, however, refutes these criticisms by pointing to their \\\\nadvanced technology, which enables the driver to arrive at the destination both securely and on time. \\\\nSWOT Analysis \\\\nStrengths \\\\n‚Ä¢ Excellent usage of technology:  With the assistance of www.locus.sh Zepto records its \\\\ncustomers\\\\\\' geographical data, traffic dynamics, delivery time, and so on. They gather and \\\\nevaluate this data to determine whether more dark establishments are needed in the region to \\\\nmeet the 10-minute objective. \\\\n‚Ä¢ Being true to their objective:  Zepto ensures that their customers\\\\\\' expectations are met by \\\\ndelivering goods in 10 minutes. Zepto achieves their ai m 90% of the time, which contributes to \\\\nbrand loyalty. \\\\n‚Ä¢ Strong financial support:  Zepto is well -funded, which allows it to expand and grow into a \\\\nmarket leader. They currently have a total funding of $360 million. \\\\n‚Ä¢ Competent Workforce: The effective management of Zepto is in the hands of highly skilled and \\\\nexperienced professionals. They are Zepto‚Äô s most valuable resource since they are well -\\\\ninformed about the market. Palicha and Vohra, the co -founders, did a fantastic job in creating \\\\ntheir team. \\\\nWeakness \\\\n‚Ä¢ Reliance on retailers: Zepto‚Äôs business strategy is primarily dependent on other businesses \\\\nand their inventory. When a retailer\\\\\\'s stock is unavailable, customers may be forced to select a \\\\nhigher-priced substitution or go without buying that item from them. \\\\n‚Ä¢ Fluctuating customer base:  To keep their clientele, Zepto must find a balance between their \\\\ndiscount strategy and keeping their delivery time under 10 minutes. \\\\n‚Ä¢ Net Income: Zepto‚Äôs operational costs are high. They need to grow their sales while decreasing  \\\\nsome of their expenditures to make their business profitable. \\\\n‚Ä¢ Nothing Unique: Zepto‚Äôs business strategy is not very unique, and any company may enter this \\\\nmarket and replicate it. \\\\n \\\\n1  https://www.vccircle.com/blinkits-marketplace-arm-s-fy22-loss-widens-to-over-rs-1-000-\\\\ncrore#:~:text=Blinkit\\\\\\'s%20marketplace%20arm\\\\\\'s%20FY22%20loss%20widens%20to%20over%20Rs%201%2C000%20crore, -\\\\nBy%20Malvika%20Maloo&text=Zomato%2Downed%20Blinkit\\\\\\'s%20marketplace%20arm,on%20transportation%2C%20contract%\\\\n20and%20advertising. \\\\nhttps://inc42.com/buzz/dunzos-loss-widens-2x-to-inr-464-cr-in-fy22-as-expenses-also-double/#:~:text=Share%20story-\\\\n,Dunzo\\\\\\'s%20Loss%20Widens%202X%20To%20INR%20464,FY22%20As%20E xpenses%20Also%20Double&text=Bengaluru%2\\\\nDbased%20hyperlocal%20delivery%20platform,due%20to%20doubling%20of%20expenses . \\\\n \\\\x0c196 International Journal of Advanced Research in Commerce, Management & Social Science (IJARCMSS)  -October-December, 2022 \\\\nOpportunity \\\\n‚Ä¢ Infiltrating further into existing locations and entering fresh  cities: One way they can \\\\noutperform their competitors is to grow their business as quickly as possible. \\\\n‚Ä¢ Various Business Ventures:  Zepto has developed a brand identity for itself, which they can \\\\nnow utilize to enter into other sectors and diversify their revenue stream. \\\\nThreats \\\\nHeavy competition: Zepto is in a league with big names. Customers swing from one app to the \\\\nnext like a pendulum. Because there is little consumer loyalty, Zepto must continually stay on top of their \\\\ngame. \\\\n Exploitation of delivery boys: There are several sceptics of the quick commerce industry. \\\\nDelivery boys are exploited in the name of quick delivery and are subjected to extreme strain, increasing \\\\nthe likelihood of an accident. \\\\nConclusion  \\\\nSince its start in April 2021, Zepto has grown organically to become one of India\\\\\\'s most valuable \\\\nand promising start -ups. Zepto has everything a successful firm requires: a talented and dedicated \\\\nworkforce, solid funding, and the use of technology to operate rapidly. However, they cannot handle huge \\\\nsales volume since the dark stores they utilise for speedy delivery are not built to support large scale \\\\noperations. They  keep a limited number of fresh items in hand because if they are not sold, they will \\\\nsuffer losses as the items stale. As a result , there is a possibility that the consumer use competitor\\\\\\'s app \\\\nsince the things they want are out of stock. \\\\nOn the face of it, if Blinkit exists& grows, it is difficult for Zepto  to be the market leader. Both \\\\nhave a nearly identical business model, and Bl inkit‚Äô s delivery time is also less than 10 minutes so \\\\nactually they both don‚Äôt have anything unique that sets them apart. The only thing that can help Zepto to \\\\ncompete with Blinkit and become a stable business firm is expanding into more cities and having  a wider \\\\nrange of products to pick from. \\\\nZepto along with other apps is effectively breaking the mould of traditional purchasing and \\\\nestablishing an e-consumerism habit. There is no doubt that Zepto is now expanding faster than anybody \\\\nelse in this sector. They are detail-oriented and employ AI-based technologies well. \\\\nZepto is expected to become a unicorn in 2023. 1However, being a unicorn does not imply that \\\\nthe firm is profitable. \\\\nIn the FY22 their revenue was considerable, as seen by the number of orders they received \\\\neach day, but their operational costs were high and  hence they suffered losses. If they want to become a \\\\nprofitable firm, they must expand into newer cities while adhering to their basic principles and finding \\\\nmethods to reduce their operational expenses. \\\\nReferences  \\\\n1. https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto/news \\\\n2. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto \\\\n3. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zepto-29b1 \\\\n4. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/grofers-trusted-delivery-partner \\\\n5.

    "Our experiment evaluated three Google Gemini models for the research agent prototype, with each showing distinct characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `gemini-2.5-pro-preview`: Produced the highest quality results but struggled with inconsistent tool calling behavior. While it occasionally made up to 8 tool calls resulting in comprehensive research, it frequently failed to utilize tools at all. Response generation took approximately 40 seconds without tool use and up to 2 minutes 30 seconds with tool use. Notably, it demonstrated minimal hallucination even without tool use, potentially due to Google's internal search-based grounding techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `gemini-2.0-flash`: Demonstrated the most consistent tool calling pattern, reliably making up to 8 tool calls per response. While its output quality was superior to the lite version, responses were somewhat shallow - though this could be addressed through prompt engineering. Response times averaged 40 seconds to 1 minute depending on the number of tool calls, offering a good balance between speed and thoroughness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`: Delivered the fastest response times (25-35 seconds) but produced the most superficial analyses. All responses were grounded in search tool calls, ensuring factual accuracy despite the limited depth.\n",

    "### LLM Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our architecture passes agent responses to another agent for downstream processing, both  and `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` are viable candidates. However, `gemini-2.0-flash` emerges as the preferred choice for these reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It makes more comprehensive use of the search tool, gathering a wider range of information\n",
    "2. It produces better quality responses with greater analytical depth\n",
    "3. Its moderate response time (40s-1m) represents an acceptable trade-off for the improved quality\n",
    "4. Further prompt engineering can likely enhance its performance\n",
    "\n",
    "While `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` offers faster processing, the depth and quality of analysis from `gemini-2.0-flash` provides more valuable input for subsequent agent processing. We recommend implementing `gemini-2.0-flash` as the primary model with targeted prompt engineering to optimize its performance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Integrating the agent into a `Hayhooks` pipeline presented challenges that hindered its functionality, causing it to return after a single tool call or message.\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome these obstacles, `FastAPI` was adopted as an alternative solution. Its straightforward integration process facilitated seamless incorporation of the agent, resulting in efficient and effective responses."
