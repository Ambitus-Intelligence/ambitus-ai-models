This innovative approach, where groceries and essential items are delivered in under 10 minutes, began as a novel concept but has rapidly evolved into a substantial business model. Central to this growth is the Zepto business model and digital marketing strategy, which has played a vital role in building the brand and driving customer engagement.\\nIt’s true – Companies like Zepto are at the forefront of this revolution, with even major corporations like Reliance recognising the potential and getting involved. However, despite its rapid expansion, the quick commerce industry faces considerable challenges, especially in terms of profitability.\\nThis article delves into how companies like Zepto are striving for success, the obstacles they encounter, and what the future might hold.\\nBut before we get into it, a quick side note – If you’re the kind of person who loves decoding marketing strategies, exploring digital marketing masters courses or enrolling in an online digital marketing course can provide valuable insights into this dynamic field.\\nLearn Digital Marketing for FREE\\n- 45 Mins Masterclass\\n- Watch Anytime, Anywhere\\n- 1,00,000+ Students Enrolled\\nSo, What is Quick Commerce?\\nQuick commerce, or Q-commerce, revolves around delivering products like groceries at lightning speed—typically within 30 minutes. The success of this model hinges on dark stores which are small warehouses strategically located close to customers. These warehouses typically store popular items that can be dispatched rapidly.\\nFor example, when you order everyday essentials like bread, eggs, and milk, a nearby dark store can have these items packed and en route to you within minutes. This sets quick commerce apart from traditional online shopping, where products may take days to arrive as they are shipped from distant warehouses.\\nThe business model of Zepto heavily depends on this approach, with dark stores being crucial for ensuring fast delivery times. This quick turnaround is a fundamental aspect of the Zepto grocery business model, which prioritises speed and convenience to attract customers.\\nIf you’re interested in how business models are developed, consider reading our digital marketing blogs and digital marketing case studies.\\nHow Dark Stores Work\\nDark stores serve as the foundation of quick commerce, enabling the rapid delivery of products. Unlike traditional grocery stores that serve walk-in customers, dark stores are dedicated exclusively to fulfilling online orders.\\nTypically located within 1.5 to 4 kilometres of the customers they serve, these stores are optimised for fast, efficient service.\\nFor instance, if you live in a bustling neighbourhood, there’s likely a dark store nearby stocked with everyday items. Once you place an order, the products are quickly picked, packed, and dispatched—often within minutes. This process is streamlined by advanced technology that assists workers in these stores to complete orders efficiently.\\nThe Zepto business model pdf available online provides a comprehensive overview of how these dark stores operate and how they contribute to the overall efficiency of the business. Understanding the Zepto business model is essential for anyone looking to explore the quick commerce sector.\\nP.S. Want to become a digital marketer or work in e-commerce? Enrolling in digital marketing classes or one of the best online marketing courses can equip you with the necessary skills to succeed in this fast-paced industry.\\nMaking Quick Commerce Profitable\\nRunning a dark store is not without its costs. Setting up such a store can range from ₹25 to ₹40 lakh, with each store requiring a staff of around 13 to 14 employees. In this industry, the average order value is between ₹350 and ₹400, with gross profit margins typically ranging from 15% to 20%.\\nHowever, achieving profitability is challenging. Gross profit represents the revenue generated before accounting for expenses like rent, salaries, and delivery costs.\\nFor instance, if the delivery cost of an order is ₹40 and the gross profit is ₹80, the net profit is only ₹40. This underscores the importance of careful cost management in the quick commerce industry.\\nThis meticulous approach to managing costs and operations is a cornerstone of the Zepto revenue model, which has enabled the company to scale rapidly in a competitive market. The efficiency of the Zepeto business model (often misspelt as “Zepeto”) is what distinguishes it from traditional retail models.\\nFun fact: If you’re aiming to build a profitable business, studying various business models, especially those regarded as the most profitable business in India, can offer valuable insights. Zepto’s success story provides a blueprint for what works in the Indian market.\\nThe Challenges of Quick Commerce\\n1) Balancing Costs and Profits\\nOne of the primary challenges facing quick commerce companies is maintaining sufficient profit margins. Even major players like D-Mart report profit margins of only around 16%.\\nFor companies like Zepto, which incur additional costs for rapid deliveries, achieving and maintaining profitable margins is particularly challenging.\\nConducting a Zepto SWOT analysis is crucial for understanding the company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and potential risks. This analysis can reveal areas where the company excels and where it may need to improve.\\nFor instance, a Zepto SWOT analysis might highlight the company’s proficiency in fast delivery while also identifying challenges related to customer acquisition costs.\\n2) Competing with Local Stores\\nMany consumers have a local store within walking distance that offers free delivery. If quick commerce companies cannot deliver quickly or fail to maintain product freshness, customers may prefer to shop locally.\\nFor example, if Zepto takes more than 30 minutes to deliver groceries, a customer might opt to visit the nearby store instead. This competition from local stores is a significant challenge for quick commerce companies.\\nHowever, the Zepto marketing strategy has been instrumental in overcoming this challenge. By emphasising the convenience and speed of their services, the Zepto marketing campaign has successfully drawn in a large customer base.\\nThe effectiveness of the Zepto digital marketing strategy has been crucial in retaining customer loyalty despite stiff competition.\\nIf you’re looking to explore digital marketing in greater detail, consider taking digital marketing courses in Mumbai or digital marketing courses in Faridabad. Both cities offer highly regarded courses in this field.\\nAlternatively, digital marketing courses in Thrissur are also an excellent choice if you’re based in southern India.\\n3) Customer Habits and Order Size\\nQuick commerce apps are frequently used for small, spontaneous purchases. For example, someone making a sandwich might order just bread, cheese, and tomatoes. These small orders make it challenging for companies to turn a profit. If companies try to impose a minimum order value, they risk diminishing the convenience factor that attracts users to quick commerce in the first place.\\nTo address this, the Zepto promotion strategy often includes discounts and special offers that encourage customers to add additional items to their carts, thus boosting the average order value. This strategy is a key part of the Zepto business plan aimed at boosting profitability.\\nUnderstanding consumer behaviour and the role of AI in this process is becoming increasingly important. Exploring the role of AI in content creation can offer insights into how companies like Zepto can personalise marketing strategies to better meet customer needs.\\n4) New Competitors\\nNew apps are emerging that offer similar services by connecting customers directly with local stores. For instance, ‘My Kirana’ in Pune allows customers to order from their local kirana stores via an app, ensuring fast delivery without the need to use Zepto. These apps pose a potential threat by taking away customers from established quick commerce platforms.\\nThe Future of Quick Commerce\\nOpportunities and Risks\\nThe quick commerce industry holds great promise but also faces significant challenges. Companies that can effectively address these challenges—by controlling delivery costs, increasing order sizes, and competing with local stores—are poised to become major players in the retail industry.\\nThe long-term success of Zepto will depend on its ability to adapt and refine its strategies. As the market continues to evolve, the business model of Zepto must remain flexible to respond to new opportunities and challenges.\\nCould Big Companies Take Over?\\nThere is also the possibility that large corporations like Reliance or D-Mart might acquire quick commerce companies like Zepto. These giants have the resources and supply chains to run such services more efficiently. For instance, if Reliance were to acquire Zepto, it could leverage Zepto’s delivery network to distribute its own products faster and at a lower cost.\\nShould such an acquisition occur, the Zepto marketing strategy would likely be significantly enhanced, integrating seamlessly with the extensive resources of a company like Reliance. This could potentially revolutionise the way quick commerce operates.\\nFor those interested in understanding how such market shifts could play out, attending afree LinkedIn essentials masterclass or exploring a free top paying skills course could provide valuable insights.\\nWant to Know Why 2,50,000+ Students Trust Us?\\nDive into the numbers that make us the #1 choice for career success\\nCourses Recommended for you\\nAditya Shastri leads the Business Development segment at IIDE and is a seasoned Content Marketing expert.

Customers get to choose from thousands of popular items including fresh farm vegetables and fruits, groceries, dairy & more at the best prices from Zepto & a Zeptonian Rider will be at the door in about 10 minutes. Zepto is growing at a 200% rise in price in 11 months, with 60% repeat customers.\\nIn April 2021, two friends, Kaivalya Vohra [CTO] and Aadit Palicha [CEO], both 19, formed Zepto. They were both admitted to Stanford University and were scheduled to acquire a Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science, but instead opted to construct Zepto. Earlier in September 2020, they started “Kirana Mart” which was a supermart delivery startup similar to Big Basket and Grofers. However, until January 2021, it was well known as Zepto.\\nZepto’s Shareholdings –\\nZepto is backed by nine investors. Major shareholders of Zepto are Kaivalya Vohra (18.8%), Aadit Palicha (22.5%), Nexus Ventures (20.7%), eBooks Private Investors (10.4%), Y Combinator (5.1%), Rocket Internet (5.7%) and others(16.8%). The most recent investors are Contrary and Glade Brook Capital Partners. The firm is currently valued at $900 million, and it has raised a total of $200 million.\\nZepto’s funding –\\nThe company has recently raised $200 million at a current valuation of $900 million in its Series D round led by Y Combinator Continuity with Kaser Permanente along with other existing investors like Nexus Venture Partners, Glade Brook Capital and Lachy Room. Although, it was looking forward to a valuation of $1 billion to attain the unicorn status it didn’t come through. Earlier in December 2021, it had raised $100 mn led by YC Continuity at a valuation of $570 million.\\nIt plans to utilise the fresh funds to grow operations, recruit more employees, improve goods, and develop its recently established ‘Zepto Cafe’ service. To serve snackable goods in 10 minutes, the Mumbai-based firm has partnered with establishments such as Blue Tokai Coffee, Chaayos, Gurukripa snacks, and Sassy Teaspoon. Tea, pastries, samosas, and coffee are among the goodies being offered.\\nAcquiring fresh talent –\\nThe talent acquisition department was one of the primary things that went correctly for the firm. They were successful in attracting numerous high-level executives from Amazon. Uber, Pharmeasy, Flipkart, and Dream 11 have all expressed interest in joining their group.\\nZepto’s 10 Minute Delivery –\\nZepto introduced its notion of 10-minute delivery. The entire sport and situation were altered. Customers were agitated, but they couldn’t do much because of the loss of many possibilities in the market. People’s impatience was exploited by Zepto with its 10min delivery value proposition.\\nHow does Zepto manage to deliver in 10 minutes?\\nThis takes us closer to Zepto’s second method, “The dark shop model.” Dark shops are basically mini-warehouses with the capacity to service all clients within a 3-kilometre radius. Zepto employs a one-of-a-kind product called Locus. This solution tracks the customer’s geostatistical data, traffic dynamics, and how long it will take for the last mile delivery. As a result, it chose whether or not to build a new Dark Store in that area.\\nLocus is an AI application that leverages the Google API and presents all relevant data on the Zepto dashboard. As a result, it is not the efficiency of the delivery guys that is important, but rather the technology.\\nThe PPB formula is another notable Zepto approach, and it is responsible for the Dark Store model’s success.\\n1) Picking- It is a quick process in all Zepto stores. All employees in their dark stores have tablets, and when an order is placed, it goes to a central hub, from there it goes to the dark store, and from there it’s given to employees because everything is reflected on their tablets, that what items are in this order and which item is placed on which place, which shelf.\\n2) Packing – All the items are collected and then packed quickly.\\n3) Bagging – As soon as the delivery agent receives the order, the agent must exit the warehouse. Zepto requires a 60-second advance time in all three procedures of choosing, packaging, and bagging.\\nZepto’s Dark Store Business Model –\\nDark storefronts may appear sinister, but they were one of the many brilliant ideas that have helped some retail enterprises survive the plague. Dark shops are distribution centres that are not available to the public. These mini-warehouses handle orders fast and accurately, providing customers with tools and alternatives such as purchasing items online, same-day delivery, or in-store pickup.\\nAccording to the founders, the secret of the dark store concept is how they choose, pack, and ship products in under 60 seconds. The last mile, on the other hand, is similar to any other delivery scheme.\\nDark stores are designed for quick deliveries and cannot handle high sales volumes. However, Zepto refused to accept this model’s flaws. They offer over a thousand things on display, including fresh vegetables, milk, meat, household supplies, and much more at the greatest prices. Moreover, their AI-powered tools ensure a smooth transition from picking, packing, and delivering.\\nExisting market participants such as Swiggy and Bigbasket could simply replicate all of these characteristics. So, how will Zepto compete with these massive corporations?\\nThe answer to this is concealed in Zepto’s massive tactic known as “Hyper Focus.”\\nSwiggy, Big Basket, and Grofers all compete on pricing, which is something they all have in common. Customers want to place their orders where they may obtain the best discounts. But Zepto is obsessed with speed. Zepto’s client acquisition approach differs from those of these organisations.\\nChallenges for Zepto –\\n1) Retainers – Acquiring and retaining customers becomes more difficult for Zepto as a result of the bulk of these organisations already having significant retainers.\\n2) Price Power Maintenance – Quick deliveries are very expensive, especially if delivery fees are not charged. Running low prices and speed at the same time is much more difficult, and to do so requires a lot of cash flow and funding.\\n3) Income economies -The third thread is “Economies of scale.” Because the daily earnings of Swiggy, Big Basket, and Grofers are likely to be quite substantial, they will have additional cash compared to Zepto, and they have also been provided investment.\\nZepto’s Future Goals –\\nIn the future, Zepto intends to grow the number of Dark Stores in order to boost the number of orders. Once they start retaining clients, they want to start collecting convenience fees. Though Zepto may face severe dangers in the near future owing to fierce rivalry, it’s incredible how two 19-year-old lads leap and shake the roots of massive corporations such as Big Basket or Blinkit, among others. It might also announce its public listing incoming 2-3 years.\\nConclusion –\\nToday’s consumer is more concerned with the cost supplied by using the brand rather than the logo itself. Because the consumer is loyal to the price supplied by the brand rather than the logo itself, continually improving the pricing proposition is the only option left for firms to survive in the market.\\nSomething is generally left unexplored in every marketplace, area, and enterprise. If we look at this circumstance, we can see that there was an untapped demand of people’s impatience by making use of what Zepto has established across the entire organisation.\\n                \\n                International Journal of Advanced Research in Commerce, Management &Social Science (IJARCMSS) 193 \\nISSN :2581-7930,  Impact Factor : 6.809, Volume 05, No. 04(II), October-December,  2022, pp 193-196 \\n  \\n \\nJUST IN 10 MINUTES: A CASE STUDY ON ZEPTO \\n \\n Dr. Sunita Gupta\\uf02a \\nAvani Pandey** \\nABSTRACT \\n \\nThis case discusses the working of Zepto , an e -commerce company founded in April 2021 in \\nBandra, Mumbai by two 19 -year-old Stanford dropouts Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra.  Well, they are \\nnot newbies in the start -up world, this is their third start -up after GoPool and Kiranakart.  They came with \\nthis ground-breaking idea while sitting in their homes and waiting for their groceries to be delivered in 2 -3 \\ndays. Zepto belongs to those start -up subgroups that experienced meteoric development in the post -\\nCovid period. This case explains the developme nt process of how the company is making it possible to \\ndeliver items in 10 minutes. Zepto has raised $360 million in funding with the lead investors being the \\nAmerican start up accelerator company Y Combinator and the American growth equity firm Glade Broo k \\nCapital Partners. Currently, the company has a valuation of $900 million. 1 So, the possibility that Zepto  \\nwill soon turn into a unicorn is not a daft idea. However, there is a major concern surrounding Zepto’ s \\nbusiness model as they have still not made the business profitable. Zepto is also facing tough \\ncompetition from its rival Blinkit (formerly known as Grofers) who was founded in December 2013. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\n \\nKeywords: Zepto, Start-up, E-commerce, Business Model, Post-Covid. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\n \\nIntroduction \\n Zepto is a quick e-commerce company that started its operations in 2021. \\n The company started its operations in Bandra, Mumbai and has subsequently extended its \\ndelivery areas to Pune, Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Ghaziabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata. \\n On October 31, 2021, a total of 8 investors, led by Glade Brook Capital Partners, invested in \\nthem $60 million after which more investors began to notice them. Later, they raised additional funding \\nthrough their series C and series D rounds. Y Combinator Continuity Fund became the major investor in \\nboth of these rounds. \\n The Series C and D rounds were held on December 20, 2021 and May 2, 2022 and raised $100 \\nmillion and $200 million respectively2.But Zepto is not the only quick commerce start-up that is backed by \\nstrong funding, it is up against fierce competition in India from Blinkit. Blinkit has received backing from \\n24 investor s and has gone through a total of 19 fundraising rounds. Blinkit is currently valued at $1 \\nbillion3. And then there is also Dunzo which is backed by Google. \\nZepto’ s tagline is \"Groceries delivered in 10 minutes”. They do this with the help of Dark stores . \\nThey are nothing but warehouses that are not open to the public and are located in such area in the \\nneighbourhood where demand is high.Only commonly requested commodities are kept in these \\nwarehouses, preventing the loss of unsold stock. Zepto’ s dark st ores are designed in a way so that \\norders are filled as rapidly as possible, effectively and efficiently reducing time. Currently, Zepto is \\ndelivering 2500+ goods, including food and drink, personal care products, fresh produce, home cleaning \\nsupplies, and  snacks and beverages, from its 100+ dark stores. As stated by the CEO of zepto  Aadit \\nPalicha the average delivery time taken by Zepto is 8 minutes and 47 seconds. \\n \\n\\uf02a Supervisor, Mentor &Associate Professor, Department of Commerce, Daulat Ram College, University of \\nDelhi, Delhi, India. \\n**  Student pursuing B.

The company uses artificial intelligence (AI) t o \\nenhance the effectiveness of its delivery network by taking into account variables like weather, traffic \\npatterns, population, geography, and the availability of last-mile supplies. \\n The co-founders have managed to make the roots of the company strong by  getting the best \\ntalent out there to work for them when they first started building a team.  They were successful in \\npersuading a number of high-profile executives from Dream 11, Amazon, Uber, Pharmeasy, and Flipkart. \\n(Source: LinkedIn) \\nThese qualified exe cutives have assisted Zepto in achieving unit economics and capital \\nefficiency. They are what have allowed Zepto to carve out a place for itself in the grocery’s delivery \\nmarket. \\nFindings  \\nGroceries account for the majority of India\\'s $1 trillion retail market.1 Consequently, this market \\nhas enormous potential. During Corona, it was challenging to leave the house every time you wanted to \\nbuy a small essential item, and today with people having to work for long hours, especially in urban cities, \\nit is challenging to go out and shop for daily groceries. The market needed an app like Zepto more than it \\nwanted one, thus its release was ideal. These apps help customers to save their time  and make their life \\neasier. As of right now, as mentioned by the C EO of zepto, they receive 100,000 orders each day, and \\ntheir demand curve is essentially flat. They once more turn to technology to determine the ideal location \\nfor their tiny fulfilment centres. \\nAlthough some would believe that Zepto’ s delivery speed is what sets them apart from the \\ncompetition, this is not the case. The key element that sets zepto apart from its rivals is not the quickness \\nof the delivery men, but rather how effectively it uses technology. Zepto tracks its customers\\' spatial data, \\ntraffic dynamics, the time it takes to deliver the items, etc. with the aid of www.locus.sh. They collect this \\ndata and analyse it to decide whether they need more dark stores in the area to be able to achieve that \\n10-minute goal. \\nZepto Generates Income in Two Ways \\n• It first negotiates a profit margin with the companies based on how much of their product is kept \\nin the warehouse. \\n• Second, they make money by charging companies for ad space and the top search results. \\n• Zepto had total revenue of INR 142.3 Cr in FY22, while incurring costs of INR 532.7 Cr. They \\nsuffered a loss of 390.3 Cr INR as a result. \\nMarketing costs make up the majority of their spending \\nThey invest a lot of money in promoting and advertising their app. During FY22, they spent INR \\n175.5 Cr, or almo st 33% of their overall expenses on marketing. In addition to this, the firm spent INR \\n213.2 Cr on stock -in-trade purchases in FY22. Employee benefits cost INR 50.3 Cr, while supply chain \\ncosts were INR 74 Cr.2 \\nZepto’ s EBITDA margin in FY22 was -259.39%.3An EBITDA offers a clear picture of the \\ncompany\\'s worth and displays it to potential buyers and investors. Unfortunately, Zepto’ s EBITDA is \\nnegative. \\n To distribute the products, Zepto utilizes gig workers. These individuals make an average \\nincome of INR 1,30,211.4 \\n Zepto has been able to outperform the competition because of its business model. They have a \\nhighly effective distribution system, and Zepto’ s AI-powered tools make it simple to manage and keep an \\neye on inventory and product selection. This leads to better in ventory management and a wider range of \\nproducts. Additionally, they have a large consumer base that is constantly growing. \\n \\n1  https://www.statista.com/statistics/1021352/india-organized-retail-market-value/https://www.statista.com/topics/5615/food-retail-in \\nindia/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20the%20food%20and%20grocery,retail%20market%20at%2063%20percent . \\n2  https://www.vccircle.com/zeptounlikely-to-turn-profitable-in-near-term \\n3  https://inc42.com/buzz/zepto-incurs-inr-390-cr-loss-in-first-year-of-operations-fy22-sales-at-inr-\\n141r/#:~:text=Zepto%2C%20which%20began%20operations%20in,stood%20at%20INR%20140.7%20Cr . \\n4  https://www.ambitionbox.com/salaries/zepto-salaries/delivery-boy \\x0cDr. Sunita Gupta & Avani Pandey: Just in 10 Minutes: A Case Study on Zepto 195 \\nDiscussion \\n Zepto is indeed facing losses but it is only natural for a fledgling enterprise in their early years of \\noperations to incur some loss.  While Zepto has suffered losses, it is still in a better situation than Blinkit \\nand Dunzo, which have suffered losses of INR 1,019 Cr and INR 464 Cr respectively.1 \\nThe quick commerce industry has a customer base that is not very devoted, s o even if delivery \\ntime increases by a few minutes, customers will still go where they can obtain the best deals. \\n Zepto has to strike a balance between discounts and deals and keep their delivery time between \\n10 and 20 minutes. Blinkit is their sole main rival at the moment in this market. They need to start \\npenetrating into newer cities if they want to distinctly emerge as the leaders of quick commerce. \\nZepto has to diversify its revenue streams and stop relying solely on a limited range of sources. \\nAccording to the founders of Zepto, they are planning to open a Zepto café that will provide popular \\nbrand’s coffee and tea. If it were to become a reality, it may  be successful since metropolitan city\\'s youth \\nrun on caffeine, and hitting up chaayos or blue tokaievery time you feel like drinking one is impractical. If \\nZepto wants to make this business a success, they will need more funding. Since Zepto has already \\nestablished a reputation for itself and everything associated with that name would benefit from its \\ngoodwill, their marketing costs shouldn\\'t be too high. \\nZepto, as well as any other rapid commerce start -up, solely receives criticism for how it treats \\ndelivery guys. Due to the shorter time constraints these workers must adhere to, they may drive rashly, \\nincreasing the chances of accidents.  Zepto, however, refutes these criticisms by pointing to their \\nadvanced technology, which enables the driver to arrive at the destination both securely and on time. \\nSWOT Analysis \\nStrengths \\n• Excellent usage of technology:  With the assistance of www.locus.sh Zepto records its \\ncustomers\\' geographical data, traffic dynamics, delivery time, and so on. They gather and \\nevaluate this data to determine whether more dark establishments are needed in the region to \\nmeet the 10-minute objective. \\n• Being true to their objective:  Zepto ensures that their customers\\' expectations are met by \\ndelivering goods in 10 minutes. Zepto achieves their ai m 90% of the time, which contributes to \\nbrand loyalty. \\n• Strong financial support:  Zepto is well -funded, which allows it to expand and grow into a \\nmarket leader. They currently have a total funding of $360 million. \\n• Competent Workforce: The effective management of Zepto is in the hands of highly skilled and \\nexperienced professionals. They are Zepto’ s most valuable resource since they are well -\\ninformed about the market. Palicha and Vohra, the co -founders, did a fantastic job in creating \\ntheir team. \\nWeakness \\n• Reliance on retailers: Zepto’s business strategy is primarily dependent on other businesses \\nand their inventory. When a retailer\\'s stock is unavailable, customers may be forced to select a \\nhigher-priced substitution or go without buying that item from them. \\n• Fluctuating customer base:  To keep their clientele, Zepto must find a balance between their \\ndiscount strategy and keeping their delivery time under 10 minutes. \\n• Net Income: Zepto’s operational costs are high. They need to grow their sales while decreasing  \\nsome of their expenditures to make their business profitable. \\n• Nothing Unique: Zepto’s business strategy is not very unique, and any company may enter this \\nmarket and replicate it. \\n \\n1  https://www.vccircle.com/blinkits-marketplace-arm-s-fy22-loss-widens-to-over-rs-1-000-\\ncrore#:~:text=Blinkit\\'s%20marketplace%20arm\\'s%20FY22%20loss%20widens%20to%20over%20Rs%201%2C000%20crore, -\\nBy%20Malvika%20Maloo&text=Zomato%2Downed%20Blinkit\\'s%20marketplace%20arm,on%20transportation%2C%20contract%\\n20and%20advertising. \\nhttps://inc42.com/buzz/dunzos-loss-widens-2x-to-inr-464-cr-in-fy22-as-expenses-also-double/#:~:text=Share%20story-\\n,Dunzo\\'s%20Loss%20Widens%202X%20To%20INR%20464,FY22%20As%20E xpenses%20Also%20Double&text=Bengaluru%2\\nDbased%20hyperlocal%20delivery%20platform,due%20to%20doubling%20of%20expenses . \\n \\x0c196 International Journal of Advanced Research in Commerce, Management & Social Science (IJARCMSS)  -October-December, 2022 \\nOpportunity \\n• Infiltrating further into existing locations and entering fresh  cities: One way they can \\noutperform their competitors is to grow their business as quickly as possible. \\n• Various Business Ventures:  Zepto has developed a brand identity for itself, which they can \\nnow utilize to enter into other sectors and diversify their revenue stream. \\nThreats \\nHeavy competition: Zepto is in a league with big names. Customers swing from one app to the \\nnext like a pendulum. Because there is little consumer loyalty, Zepto must continually stay on top of their \\ngame. \\n Exploitation of delivery boys: There are several sceptics of the quick commerce industry. \\nDelivery boys are exploited in the name of quick delivery and are subjected to extreme strain, increasing \\nthe likelihood of an accident. \\nConclusion  \\nSince its start in April 2021, Zepto has grown organically to become one of India\\'s most valuable \\nand promising start -ups. Zepto has everything a successful firm requires: a talented and dedicated \\nworkforce, solid funding, and the use of technology to operate rapidly. However, they cannot handle huge \\nsales volume since the dark stores they utilise for speedy delivery are not built to support large scale \\noperations. They  keep a limited number of fresh items in hand because if they are not sold, they will \\nsuffer losses as the items stale. As a result , there is a possibility that the consumer use competitor\\'s app \\nsince the things they want are out of stock. \\nOn the face of it, if Blinkit exists& grows, it is difficult for Zepto  to be the market leader. Both \\nhave a nearly identical business model, and Bl inkit’ s delivery time is also less than 10 minutes so \\nactually they both don’t have anything unique that sets them apart. The only thing that can help Zepto to \\ncompete with Blinkit and become a stable business firm is expanding into more cities and having  a wider \\nrange of products to pick from. \\nZepto along with other apps is effectively breaking the mould of traditional purchasing and \\nestablishing an e-consumerism habit. There is no doubt that Zepto is now expanding faster than anybody \\nelse in this sector. They are detail-oriented and employ AI-based technologies well. \\nZepto is expected to become a unicorn in 2023. 1However, being a unicorn does not imply that \\nthe firm is profitable. \\nIn the FY22 their revenue was considerable, as seen by the number of orders they received \\neach day, but their operational costs were high and  hence they suffered losses. If they want to become a \\nprofitable firm, they must expand into newer cities while adhering to their basic principles and finding \\nmethods to reduce their operational expenses. \\nReferences  \\n1. https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto/news \\n2. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto \\n3. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zepto-29b1 \\n4. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/grofers-trusted-delivery-partner \\n5.

      "GeneratedAnswer(data='Okay, here is an analysis of Zepto\\'s current business, technical, and marketing strategies, drawing upon available information.\\n\\n***\\n\\n## Zepto: Analysis of Business, Technical, and Marketing Strategies\\n\\nZepto, an Indian quick commerce company founded in 2021, has rapidly gained prominence by promising grocery and essential item delivery within 10 minutes. This analysis explores its core strategies across business, technology, and marketing, and how they contribute to its growth.\\n\\n### 1. Business Strategy\\n\\nZepto\\'s business strategy revolves around speed, density, and operational efficiency within the quick commerce (q-commerce) model.\\n\\n*   **Core Model: Quick Commerce & Dark Stores:** Zepto operates on a hyperlocal delivery model using a network of \"dark stores\" or micro-fulfillment centers. These are strategically located in high-demand neighborhoods, enabling riders to pick up orders and deliver them within the promised 10-minute timeframe [Source: Zepto](https://www.zeptonow.com/). This differs significantly from traditional e-commerce which relies on larger, more distant warehouses.\\n*   **Focus on Density and Efficiency:** The model\\'s success hinges on high population density and optimizing every step of the process – from inventory management in the dark store to last-mile delivery route planning. Zepto aims for operational efficiency to manage the costs associated with rapid delivery [Source: Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/start-ups/how-zepto-is-optimising-delivery-operational-efficiency-in-quick-commerce-124022700707_1.html).\\n*   **Expansion and Market Position:** Zepto expanded rapidly across major Indian cities after its launch. While initially focused purely on speed, there\\'s evidence suggesting a maturing strategy focusing on sustainable growth and improving unit economics [Source: Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/start-ups/how-zepto-is-optimising-delivery-operational-efficiency-in-quick-commerce-124022700707_1.html). They achieved Unicorn status (valuation over $1 billion) remarkably quickly, indicating strong investor confidence in their model and execution [Source: Forbes India](https://www.forbesindia.com/article/startups/zepto-founders-aadit-palicha-and-kaivalya-vohra-the-fast-and-the-furious/80269/1).\\n*   **Path to Profitability:** Like many players in the q-commerce space, achieving profitability is a key challenge. Zepto has indicated a focus on improving its Average Order Value (AOV) and optimizing its dark store network and supply chain to move towards profitability, potentially ahead of an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the future [Source: Inc42 Media](https://inc42.com/buzz/ahead-of-ipo-zepto-looks-to-achieve-profitability-eyes-positive-cash-flow-in-fy25/).\\n\\n**Contribution to Growth:** The core 10-minute delivery promise, enabled by the dark store network, was a major differentiator that fueled initial rapid customer acquisition and market share gains in a competitive landscape. Raising significant funding allowed for aggressive expansion and scaling of this model [Source: Forbes India](https://www.forbesindia.com/article/startups/zepto-founders-aadit-palicha-and-kaivalya-vohra-the-fast-and-the-furious/80269/1).\\n\\n### 2. Technical Strategy\\n\\nTechnology is fundamental to Zepto\\'s operations, enabling the speed and efficiency required for quick commerce.\\n\\n*   **Key Technical Domains:**\\n    *   **Logistics & Supply Chain Management:** This is paramount. Technology optimizes inventory placement within dark stores, predicts demand, manages stock levels in real-time, and plans the most efficient delivery routes.\\n    *   **Location Intelligence:** Precisely mapping dark store locations, understanding delivery zones, and real-time tracking of riders are crucial.\\n    *   **Data Analytics & AI/ML:** Zepto heavily utilizes data to forecast demand patterns, optimize store layouts for faster picking, personalize customer experiences, and improve overall operational decision-making [Source: Analytics India Magazine](https://analyticsindiamag.com/zepto-data-science-team-ai-ml-models/).\\n    *   **Mobile Application:** The customer-facing app needs to be seamless, fast, and reliable, providing accurate order tracking and a smooth user experience. Backend systems must handle high transaction volumes efficiently.\\n*   **Ongoing/Upcoming Projects (Inferred):** While specific internal project names aren\\'t public, ongoing efforts likely focus on:\\n    *   Improving prediction accuracy for demand forecasting.\\n    *   Enhancing route optimization algorithms to reduce delivery times further and minimize costs.\\n    *   Developing more sophisticated inventory management systems to reduce waste and ensure availability.\\n    *   Experimenting with AI for personalized recommendations and promotions within the app.\\n    *   Potentially exploring automation within dark stores where feasible.\\n*   **Recently Released Products/Features:** Rather than physical products, Zepto\\'s \"releases\" often involve service expansions or app features. Examples could include:\\n    *   **Category Expansions:** Adding new product categories beyond basic groceries (e.g., snacks, beverages, personal care, potentially basic pharmacy items where regulations allow).\\n    *   **Zepto Café:** Launching services like Zepto Café, offering quick snacks and beverages, leverages the existing delivery infrastructure for a new use case [Source: Inc42 Media](https://inc42.com/buzz/zepto-turns-profitable-at-ebitda-level-launches-zepto-cafe/).\\n    *   **Private Labels:** Introducing own-brand products (\\'Zepto Bloom Farm\\', \\'Zepto Essentials\\') to improve margins [Source: Entrackr](https://entrackr.com/2024/06/zepto-launches-private-labels-in-multiple-categories/).\\n\\n**Contribution to Growth:** Zepto\\'s sophisticated tech stack is the engine behind its value proposition. It allows them to execute the complex logistics of 10-minute delivery consistently, which builds customer trust and loyalty. Data analytics helps optimize operations, control costs, and improve unit economics, contributing to sustainable growth [Source: Analytics India Magazine](https://analyticsindiamag.com/zepto-data-science-team-ai-ml-models/).\\n\\n### 3. Marketing Strategy\\n\\nZepto\\'s marketing focuses on building brand awareness around its core promise of speed and convenience, primarily targeting a young, urban demographic.\\n\\n*   **Target Audience:** Primarily tech-savvy millennials and Gen Z in metropolitan areas who value speed, convenience, and instant gratification.\\n*   **Core Messaging:** The \"10-minute delivery\" promise has been central to their branding and communication from the outset.\\n*   **Channels:**\\n    *   **Digital Marketing:** Heavy reliance on online channels, including social media advertising (Instagram, Facebook), search engine marketing (SEM), and partnerships with influencers.\\n    *   **Performance Marketing:** Focus on campaigns that drive direct app installs and first orders.\\n    *   **Out-of-Home (OOH):** Using billboards and other physical advertisements in key urban locations to build brand visibility.\\n    *   **Referral Programs:** Encouraging existing users to refer new customers.\\n*   **Innovative Approaches:**\\n    *   **Hyperlocal Marketing:** Tailoring promotions or communications based on specific neighborhoods or even particular apartment complexes.\\n    *   **Moment Marketing:** Capitalizing on current events or trends for timely social media content.\\n    *   **Focus on User Experience:** While not strictly marketing, the seamless app experience and reliable fast delivery act as powerful retention marketing tools. The launch of Zepto Pass, a loyalty program, aims to increase customer retention and order frequency [Source: Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/zepto-launches-loyalty-programme-zepto-pass-to-take-on-blinkit-others-124041800823_1.html).\\n\\n**Contribution to Growth:** Zepto\\'s aggressive and focused marketing, centered on the compelling \"10-minute\" promise, rapidly built brand awareness and drove initial customer adoption. Digital channels effectively reached their target demographic. Referral programs and a focus on a smooth customer experience have likely aided user retention and organic growth. The introduction of loyalty programs like Zepto Pass indicates a strategic shift towards retaining existing customers alongside acquisition efforts [Source: Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/news/zepto-launches-loyalty-programme-zepto-pass-to-take-on-blinkit-others-124041800823_1.html).\\n\\n***\\n\\nIn conclusion, Zepto\\'s growth has been driven by a synergistic strategy: a disruptive business model focused on speed via dark stores, enabled by a robust technical infrastructure for logistics and data analysis, and promoted through aggressive, digitally-focused marketing targeting convenience-seeking urban consumers. As the market matures, Zepto appears to be evolving its strategy to balance rapid growth with operational efficiency and a clearer path towards profitability.', query=\"Analyze Zepto's current business, technical, and marketing strategies.

       "Zepto, an Indian quick commerce company founded in 2021, has rapidly gained prominence by promising grocery and essential item delivery within 10 minutes. This analysis explores its core strategies across business, technology, and marketing, and how they contribute to its growth.\n",
       "\n",
       "### 1. Business Strategy\n",
       "\n",
       "Zepto's business strategy revolves around speed, density, and operational efficiency within the quick commerce (q-commerce) model.\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Core Model: Quick Commerce & Dark Stores:** Zepto operates on a hyperlocal delivery model using a network of \"dark stores\" or micro-fulfillment centers. These are strategically located in high-demand neighborhoods, enabling riders to pick up orders and deliver them within the promised 10-minute timeframe [Source: Zepto](https://www.zeptonow.com/). This differs significantly from traditional e-commerce which relies on larger, more distant warehouses.\n",
       "*   **Focus on Density and Efficiency:** The model's success hinges on high population density and optimizing every step of the process – from inventory management in the dark store to last-mile delivery route planning. Zepto aims for operational efficiency to manage the costs associated with rapid delivery [Source: Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/start-ups/how-zepto-is-optimising-delivery-operational-efficiency-in-quick-commerce-124022700707_1.html).\n",
       "*   **Expansion and Market Position:** Zepto expanded rapidly across major Indian cities after its launch. While initially focused purely on speed, there's evidence suggesting a maturing strategy focusing on sustainable growth and improving unit economics [Source: Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/companies/start-ups/how-zepto-is-optimising-delivery-operational-efficiency-in-quick-commerce-124022700707_1.html).

       "*   **Path to Profitability:** Like many players in the q-commerce space, achieving profitability is a key challenge. Zepto has indicated a focus on improving its Average Order Value (AOV) and optimizing its dark store network and supply chain to move towards profitability, potentially ahead of an Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the future [Source: Inc42 Media](https://inc42.com/buzz/ahead-of-ipo-zepto-looks-to-achieve-profitability-eyes-positive-cash-flow-in-fy25/).\n",

       "    *   **Mobile Application:** The customer-facing app needs to be seamless, fast, and reliable, providing accurate order tracking and a smooth user experience. Backend systems must handle high transaction volumes efficiently.\n",
       "*   **Ongoing/Upcoming Projects (Inferred):** While specific internal project names aren't public, ongoing efforts likely focus on:\n",
       "    *   Improving prediction accuracy for demand forecasting.\n",

You should be familiar with the Zepto business model if you are looking to enter the market.\\\\nThe supermarket delivery industry is booming, thank goodness, because it requires less time, effort, and money than other industries. In 2020, the projected value of the online grocery business was $2.9 billion. Through this article, we will go over the basics of Zepto, including its business model and how it generates revenue.\\\\nAbout Zepto\\\\nZepto, founded in 2021 by Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, two former Stanford University students, is a platform for quick commerce that provides a grocery delivery service within 10 minutes. Fast grocery delivery was the driving force for the founding of the firm. Zepto boasts delivery to major cities like Bengaluru, Lucknow, Delhi, Chennai, etc., from its Mumbai headquarters. The original company, Kiranakart Technologies Private Limited, was turned off into Zepto by its founders.\\\\nZepto Business Model\\\\nThe \"dark store model\" serves as the foundation for Zepto\\\\\\'s business model. This involves setting up delivery-only warehouse-style stores in residential regions. The shops sell a variety of products, and the sole way for buyers to place orders is through the Zepto India website or app. Across multiple regions, Zepto now has more than eighty-six dark storefronts. Dark businesses are great for quick shipping, but they may crash under heavy traffic. However, Zepto created an AI-driven system to assist with selecting, packing, and shipping to avoid sacrificing quality or service. Zepto can provide an extensive product line at rock-bottom prices because of this technology, which guarantees a seamless transition from choosing to packaging to delivery.\\\\nZepto India can provide a fast delivery service thanks to the convenience of having outlets close to customers\\\\\\' homes, which is an advantage of the Zepto business model. The elimination of the necessity for employees to utilize the store also allows the company to run with a reduced headcount.\\\\nHow Zepto Makes Money | Zepto Revenue Model\\\\nA little commission is charged for each order placed using the Zepto Grocery app in India.

Inviting founders and startups who are building sustainable solutions from ground zero! Startups who run the show, StartupTalky will let the world know!\\\\nZepto - Startup Story\\\\nMany of us have \"startup ideas,\" but even the most creative among us struggle to see them through. Palicha and Vohra had both enrolled at Stanford to earn a Computer Science degree but had dropped out to follow their business passions instead.\\\\nThe story of Zepto started during the COVID-19 outbreak. The concept for Zepto sprang from the limitations of their houses. A surge in demand for delivery services meant that groceries and other necessities would arrive in a couple of days, creating a void for quick delivery. As a result, Zepto was created with all this insight.\\\\nThese teenagers were abruptly detained, because of Covid norms, detained in their Mumbai homes after significant collaboration on many projects, including a ride-hailing commuting app for kids. Even while grocery delivery, which was deemed important by local authorities, was still permitted across much of the nation as the virus spread, the duo battled to get their provisions as the illness expanded.\\\\nWhile Zepto is the focus of attention, Palicha and Vohra\\\\\\'s first venture, KiranaKart, did not receive the same acclaim. Zepto, on the other hand, is inspired by KiranaKart. KiranaKart, as its name implies, was a supermarket delivery service. It had made arrangements with Kirana merchants to provide groceries in 45 minutes or less. A $730,000 pre-seed round was led by Global Founders Capital, 2 AM Ventures, Contrary Capital, and angel investors. At the time, Vohra and Palicha planned to make the first 1.5 lakh deliveries for INR 1.\\\\nZepto - Mission and Vision\\\\nAs two bachelors living alone, the founders found it most difficult to obtain food, therefore, they focused their applications on grocery delivery. So, whereas KiranaKart, their first startup, tried to make grocery delivery easier for Kiranas, Zepto aims to shorten delivery times.\\\\nZepto - Name, Logo, and Tagline\\\\nThe firm, which uses the term \"Zepto\" to denote \"a factor of 10⁻²¹, i.e. 0.000000000000000000001,\" named after a minuscule unit of time, offers a 10-minute grocery delivery service, surpassing numerous well-funded competitors.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s tagline says, \"Groceries delivered in 10 minutes\".\\\\nZepto - Business and Revenue Model\\\\nZepto delivers groceries in ten minutes through a system of dark storefronts and mini-warehouses, on up to 90% of orders. Zepto works in the quick commerce segment of India. It is designed to be customer-centric and built around the instant service model.\\\\nTo ensure a flawless delivery experience, Aadit says that their average delivery time is 8 minutes and 47 seconds. Through a chain of dark stores or retail distribution centers, the Mumbai-based company employs a hotspot method to cater largely to digital purchases.\\\\nA dark store is a tiny neighborhood storehouse that customers cannot visit but purchase online to get packaged delivery. While dark stores are not new to the Indian industry, Aadit believes that the idea has yet to be completely explored. Population, traffic dynamics, topography, road patterns, weather conditions, last-mile operational improvement, real estate prices, and other geographic data and local intelligence aid Zepto in optimizing its connectivity. Furthermore, the startup\\\\\\'s dark warehouses and cool rooms are custom-designed to satisfy particular criteria such as ease of travel, allowing packers to move as swiftly as possible to fill orders.\\\\nLocation intelligence and geographic data, such as topography, population, road patterns, traffic dynamics, weather, last-mile supply availability, real estate values, and so on, are said to help Zepto optimize its network.\\\\nZepto - Funding and Investors\\\\nZepto, the Mumbai-based quick commerce unicorn, achieved unicorn status in August 2023 after raising $200 million in a Series E funding round, which brought its valuation to $1.4 billion. This milestone marked the end of India\\\\\\'s 11-month unicorn drought. The Series E round was led by The StepStone Group, with participation from Goodwater Capital and existing investors.\\\\nIn June 2024, Zepto raised $665 million, which valued the company at $3.6 billion. Just a few months later, on August 30, 2024, Zepto raised $340 million in Series G funding, which increased its valuation to $5 billion. The Series G round was led by General Catalyst, with Dragon Fund and Epiq Capital joining as new investors. Existing backers such as StepStone, Lightspeed, DST, and Contrary also increased their investments, reflecting strong confidence in Zepto\\\\\\'s growth potential.\\\\nIn November 2024, Zepto raised another $350 million from a group of domestic investors, led by Motilal Oswal\\\\\\'s private wealth division, at a flat valuation of $5 billion. This brings the total funding raised by Zepto to $2 billion.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s initial seed funding in September 2020 was led by Contrary.\\\\n| Date | Round | Amount | Lead Investors |\\\\n|---|---|---|---|\\\\n| November 21, 2024 | Series G | $350 | Motilal Oswal Wealth |\\\\n| August 30, 2024 | Series G | $340 million | General Catalyst, Mars Growth Capital |\\\\n| June 21, 2024 | Series F | $665 million | Glade Brook Capital Partners, Nexus Venture Partners, StepStone Group |\\\\n| Nov 8, 2023 | Series E | $31.3 million | Goodwater Capital, Nexus Venture Partners |\\\\n| Aug 25, 2023 | Series E | $200 million | StepStone Group |\\\\n| May 2, 2022 | Series D | $200 million | Y Combinator Continuity Fund |\\\\n| Dec 20, 2021 | Series C | $100 million | Y Combinator Continuity Fund |\\\\n| Oct 31, 2021 | Series B | $60 million | Glade Brook Capital Partners |\\\\n| Mar 22, 2021 | Series A | $6.5 million | Nexus Venture Partners |\\\\n| Sep 1, 2020 | Pre Seed Round | - | Contrary |\\\\nZepto - Shareholding\\\\nZepto shareholding pattern as of October 2024 (source: Tracxn):\\\\n| Zepto Shareholders | Percentage |\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n| Aadit Palicha | 0.9% |\\\\n| Kaivalya Vohra | 0.7% |\\\\n| Nexus Venture Partners | 18.6% |\\\\n| Glade Brook Capital | 10.3% |\\\\n| StepStone Group | 9.8% |\\\\n| Y Combinator | 8.7% |\\\\n| LGF Scale I | 7.8% |\\\\n| Rocket Internet | 3.0% |\\\\n| General Catalyst | 4.1% |\\\\n| Goodwater Capital | 1.8% |\\\\n| Razor\\\\\\'s Edge Ventures | 1.6% |\\\\n| Contrary | 1.6% |\\\\n| Kaiser Permanente | 2.3% |\\\\n| avra | 1.3% |\\\\n| SpringBlue Capital | 1.0% |\\\\n| Lightspeed Venture Partners | 0.8% |\\\\n| Global Founders Capital | 0.8% |\\\\n| Crimson | 0.5% |\\\\n| Vanderbilt University | 0.3% |\\\\n| Mangum | 0.3% |\\\\n| Bayhouse Capital | 0.2% |\\\\n| Mehta Ventures | <0.1% |\\\\n| Contrary Capital | <0.1% |\\\\n| Zpt Holdings | 2.1% |\\\\n| AZ04 | 1.4% |\\\\n| Kiranakart SPV | 0.6% |\\\\n| Sayacorps | 0.4% |\\\\n| C Opportunities | 0.1% |\\\\n| Jung Lish Lee | 2.3% |\\\\n| Oliver Jung | 0.7% |\\\\n| Oleg Wladimir Nicolas Tscheltzoff | 0.2% |\\\\n| Aditi Javesh Jhaveri | <0.1% |\\\\n| Manoj Chawla | <0.1% |\\\\n| Kavit Dilip Palicha | 8.0% |\\\\n| Jaideep Vohra | 6.7% |\\\\n| Other Investors | 1.0% |\\\\nAmong the shareholders, Nexus Venture Partners holds the largest stake, holding 18.6% of Zepto.

To prepare for its IPO, the company set up a new entity, Zepto Marketplace Private Limited, in October 2024 to simplify its operations. Zepto currently operates under a B2B model, sourcing products directly from brands and selling them to its partner companies, which then distribute the products to customers under a licensing agreement.\\\\nIn January 2025, Zepto completed its domicile shift from Singapore to India ahead of its IPO, which is now expected to raise between $800 million and $1 billion, including secondaries. Initially, the company targeted a $450 million primary capital raise.\\\\nZepto has hired Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Axis Capital as advisors for the IPO. This marks a key step in its journey as a leader in the quick commerce industry.\\\\nZepto - Growth and Revenue\\\\nZepto has seen impressive growth, serving 10 major cities with 1,000+ employees. They deliver more than 5,000 products, revolutionizing the Indian grocery segment with 10-minute delivery, advanced tech, and optimized centers.\\\\nEngineering, operations, marketing, and financial positions are also available at Zepto. Palicha claims that month-over-month growth is 200%, with a monthly retention rate of 78%.\\\\n“We are looking at a pretty crazy runrate,” he said. “In the past one and a half months, we have grown our business by 10 times. And now we are working to grow another 10 times by February or March,” said Palicha in December 2021.\\\\nZepto, when it was a five-month-old startup, had secured a valuation of $570 million after raising $100 million in a Series C round headed by Y Combinator\\\\\\'s Continuity Fund, which was a 2X increase from its previous valuation of $60 million only 45 days before that. Zepto raised another round led by Y Combinator to lift its valuation further to $900 million, so there is certainly impressive growth that the company has received in funding as well.\\\\nAnother positive development for Zepto has been the expertise it has been able to acquire. Plenty of well-known senior executives from Uber, Flipkart, Dream11, Amazon, and Pharmeasy have joined the team.\\\\nAccording to Palicha, one of the reasons why several entrepreneurs have chosen Zepto is that it has enabled individuals who had transferred from Mumbai to Bangalore to come back to their homes. He says, nevertheless, that the startup\\\\\\'s rapid development, rigorous execution, and ambitions have captivated others who share his interests. \"We\\\\\\'ve been able to walk the walk,\" he said.\\\\n“They originally launched with a different model, swiftly pivoted to quick commerce in August 2021 and are now adding 100,000 new customers every week, 60% of them women. Their attention to detail on the logistics experience is unparalleled and this has enabled them to scale to most major metros in just 5 months. Simply put, we’re confident Zepto will win in this space over the long-term,\" said Anu Hariharan, a partner at Y Combinator, in a statement.\\\\nZepto has demonstrated significant growth in recent times, with the majority of its dark stores now operating profitably. According to co-founder and CEO Aadit Palicha, Zepto has successfully established its presence in major metro cities in India with over 300-400 dark stores. Impressively, approximately 50–60 percent of these dark stores have started generating cash flows, indicating the effectiveness of Zepto\\\\\\'s business model and operational strategies. This noteworthy achievement highlights Zepto\\\\\\'s commitment to sustainable growth and profitability in the fiercely competitive quick-commerce industry.\\\\nZepto Financials\\\\n| Zepto Financials | FY22 | FY23 | FY24 |\\\\n|---|---|---|---|\\\\n| Operating Revenue | INR 142.3 crore | INR 2,026 crore | INR 4,454 crore |\\\\n| Expenses | INR 532.7 crore | INR 3,350 crore | INR 5,754 crore |\\\\n| Profit/Loss | INR 390.3 crore (loss) | INR 1,272 crore (loss) | INR 1,248 crore (loss) |\\\\nIn FY23, the quick-commerce startup’s operating revenue stood at INR 2,026 crore.

Ansh Nanda, an alleged co-founder of the startup said that he was forced to relinquish his stakes in the startup by the other cofounders and by Nexus Ventures. This was carried forward by Nanda, who lodged an FIR against the cofounders of Zepto and the Nexus Ventures partner, Suvir Sujan. However, the co-founders responded to the same without much delay by approaching the Delhi High Court. Zepto is the third startup that is backed by Nexus and where one of the co-founders has been named in an FIR. YoloBus and Acko were two other companies that dealt with the same before.\\\\nZepto - Advertisements and Social Media Campaigns\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s marketing strategy has been a key driver of its rapid growth in the quick-commerce industry. The creative brilliance of L&K Saatchi & Saatchi was evident in three earlier ads promoting Zepto\\\\\\'s products and services.\\\\nBuilding on this success, Zepto continued to impress with new campaigns featuring celebrated singers like Kailash Kher, Shankar Mahadevan, and Usha Uthup during the IPL season of 2022. These unique and melodic campaigns resonated with audiences, boosting Zepto\\\\\\'s visibility and brand appeal.\\\\nFurthermore, the launch of the \"Nahi Milega\" campaign in March 2023, featuring the character \"Uncle Ji,\" highlighted unlimited free deliveries, solidifying Zepto\\\\\\'s position as the go-to platform for ultra-fast and cost-effective grocery delivery. With an innovative approach and successful marketing initiatives, Zepto has emerged as a leading player in the competitive quick-commerce industry, catering to the needs of time-conscious consumers.\\\\nZepto - Competitors\\\\nMany businesses compete with Zepto and have already been driving fast-paced delivery of groceries like:\\\\n- Swiggy Instamart\\\\n- Blinkit\\\\n- Big Basket\\\\nDunzo is another startup, that uses its Xpress Mart dark shop network to deliver groceries in Bengaluru in 19 minutes and competes with Zepto.\\\\nZepto - Future Plans\\\\nZepto currently operates in major cities across India, including Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Ghaziabad, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, and Kolkata.

Just like window shopping, you can select and buy groceries that will be delivered to you. However, most of the delivery services take almost thirty minutes to deliver the product but there is a company that delivers the groceries within 10 minutes after placing the order. That company is none other than “Zepto.”\\\\nHave you ever wondered how Zepto delivers the order so quickly and how it gained its reputation within three years of establishment? The reason behind this success is their impactful and smart business technique. This article provides an explanation of the “Zepto Business Model.”\\\\nThe business model of Zepto consists of three essential components-\\\\n- Working Strategy\\\\n- Marketing Strategy\\\\n- Revenue Sources\\\\nWorking Strategy\\\\nThe main objective of Zepto is to provide the best and quickest service to its customers. The efficient working strategy of Zepto is based on four pillars, namely-\\\\n1: Q- Commerce\\\\nIt stands for quick commerce. It is an instant service model of e-commerce where the marketing and dealings (buying & selling) of products & services occur on the internet. Zepto efficiently utilizes the internet to execute its business. The customers place their orders on the Zepto app and their products are delivered quickly with the help of dark store models or micro markets. It delivers various types of items like fresh produce, snacks, beverages, dry rations, cleaning items, personal care items, etc.\\\\n2: Dark Store Model\\\\nThis is the core working strategy of Zepto. The dark stores are Micro Warehouses (the physical outlets) specially installed for the distribution of the products. These are not open to visitors i.e., you cannot buy the products directly (offline) from the distribution outlets of Zepto. The dark store uses advanced AI-powered technology to perform various tasks ranging from placement of orders, packaging the products, mapping the traffic-free routes for quick delivery routes, and buying fresh grocery items from the bulk distributors. You need to place the order on the Zepto app. Thereafter, their team fulfills the orders and delivers the product to your doorstep.\\\\n3: Key Partners\\\\nThere are three key partners of Zepto- Local Stores, Financial Partners, and Delivery Partners. Zepto buys the groceries in bulk from the local stores and transfers them into the dark stores (micro warehouses). The financial partners aid in the digital payment systems for Zepto. The delivery partners help in the delivery of products from dark stores to customers.\\\\n4: Usage of AI–Powered Technology\\\\nAI-powered technology is the key reason for the smooth working of Zepto. It utilizes location intelligence and geospatial data to determine the target population/audience, geographical location of the customers, patterns of roads, traffic dynamics (to select the roads having less traffic/crowd), supply availability (availability of the products that the customer ordered), weather conditions (for instance, heavy rainfall may disrupt the product delivery), values of the real estate (for establishing a dark store), etc.\\\\nIn short, the customers register and log in to the Zepto app and place an order. The dark store present in the nearest location of the customer receives the notification about the order of the customer. The team present in the dark store packs the item and hands it over to the delivery partner. The delivery man delivers the order to the location of the customer by using the quickest possible route. Finally, the customer receives the product and makes the payments.\\\\nMarketing Strategy\\\\nThe marketing strategy of Zepto mainly involves online Ad campaigns. The ad campaigns of Zepto are one of the best among its competitors. Their advertisements are quirky enough with the tagline of “10-minute delivery” and “zero delivery charges” to hit the target audience and encourage them to use Zepto app. The quick delivery of products within 10 minutes is the USP (Unique Selling Proposition) that helps it stand out among its competitors. Other than ad campaigns, Zepto uses the following marketing strategies-\\\\n- Social Media Marketing\\\\n- Influencer Marketing\\\\n- Television commercials\\\\nRevenue Sources\\\\nThe major revenue of Zepto lies in its “Commission Based Model” and funding rounds.\\\\n- Commissions– It receives a commission of 2-4% on each order placed through its app. These commissions help to cover the costs of the expenditures.\\\\n- Funding Rounds- It raised a significant amount of money through multiple funding rounds. As of today, the value of Zepto is around USD 900 million.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nThe impactful working and marketing strategy of Zepto has played a key role in the success of this quickest-growing startup.

But how does the incredibly quick delivery work? Unlike other grocery delivery services, which often take 30 minutes. The heart of Zepto is included in this blog. Continue reading to the end to learn more.\\\\nAbout Zepto\\\\nA startup in Mumbai named Zepto provides a 10-minute grocery delivery service. Zepto is a startup founded by Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra that specialises in quick grocery delivery business.\\\\nZepto is praised for being an expert at delivering food before the new year. In 2021, it produced more than one million deliveries while collaborating with 86+ owners of dark stores in thirteen different locations. Zepto uses its network of “cloud shops” or “micro-warehouses” to fill orders quickly.\\\\nZepto’s key to success is its ability to regularly manufacture over 2,500 items for delivery in less than ten minutes. Everything the company does is centred around that, which is how they’ve been able to expand so swiftly while keeping amazing client loyalty.\\\\nThe Parel-based speedy grocery delivery business has reduced the time it takes to deliver groceries to only 10 minutes, thanks to the dark store concept. Rapid commerce is reportedly the next big opportunity the grocery delivery industry wants to seize. Among the fastest-growing businesses in the faster-delivery industry are startups like Zepto in India and Fridge No More in New York City.\\\\nZepto – Industry\\\\nZepto: Industry The $1 trillion retail industry in India, where groceries account for the great majority of consumer expenditure, is helping e-grocery delivery gain pace. The Indian e-grocery market was estimated to be worth $2.9 billion in 2020, and from 2021 to 2028, it is anticipated to increase at a rate of 37.1 per cent.\\\\nDue to changing consumer preferences, increasing urbanisation, and a tech-savvy population that prefers to make purchases online, the industry has seen an increase in prominence over the past few months.\\\\nAccording to a RedSeer report, the fast commerce market will be worth $30 million by 2021. The same market was expected to rise by 15X to $5 billion in 2025.\\\\nConsumers increasingly use specialised and practical internet platforms for food shopping instead of going to their neighbourhood stores as their standard of living rises, and their daily schedules become busier.\\\\nThe appeal of internet grocery delivery business was more apparent after the COVID-19 outbreak. Due to social distance restrictions, consumers are switching to online food shopping because it is not only practical but also secure.\\\\nZepto – Founders and Team\\\\nAadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, two childhood friends who are both 19 years old, founded Zepto after leaving Stanford University’s esteemed computer science department to go back to their native India and launch a business. The business started operating in April of this year after being created in September of the previous year.\\\\nAadit Palicha\\\\nThe CEO and Co-Founder of both Zepto and KiranaKart is Aadit Palicha. Palicha completed a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Stanford University after earning an IB diploma in Mathematics and Computer Science from GEMS Education. Following the completion of Y Combinator Grade: W21, Aadit began working as a Project Lead for PryvaSee. Then, at the age of 17, Aadit Palicha launched GoPool, his first firm. In April 2020, he quit the company and started KiranaKart and Zepto.\\\\nKaivalya Vohra\\\\nKaivalya Vohra is a co-founder and chief technology officer of both Zepto and KiranaKart. He attended Y Combinator with Aadit and has a computer science degree from Stanford University.\\\\nThe number of employees at Zepto ranges from 51 to 200.\\\\nZepto – Startup Story\\\\nEven those of us who are the most creative struggle to see through our “startup ideas,” which are many. Palicha and Vohra had both enrolled at Stanford to pursue degrees in computer science but had left to pursue their interests in entrepreneurship.\\\\nZepto was born out of the constraints of their homes during the Covid-19 outbreak. Groceries and other necessities would arrive in a few days due to increased demand for delivery services, leaving a gap for speedy delivery. Zepto was then developed using all of this knowledge.\\\\nThese youngsters worked together on numerous initiatives, including a ride-hailing app for children, before being abruptly imprisoned in their Mumbai homes due to Covid restrictions. As the virus spread across the country, grocery delivery business—which local authorities still considered to be important—was still allowed in many areas. Still, the two struggled to receive their supplies as the epidemic grew.\\\\nZepto is getting all the limelight, but Palicha and Vohra’s initial business, KiranaKart, did not get the same attention. On the other hand, Zepto draws inspiration from KiranaKart. KiranaKart was a grocery delivery business, as its name suggests. With Kirana traders, it has made arrangements to deliver groceries in 45 minutes or less. Global Founders Capital, 2 AM Ventures, Contrary Capital, and angel investors led a $730,000 pre-seed investment. At the time, Vohra and Palicha intended to charge Rs 1 for the initial 1.5 lakh delivery.\\\\nZepto Business Model: Dark Store model\\\\nDark storefronts may appear ominous, but they undercut one of the many clever strategies that have kept some retail establishments afloat during the pandemic. Dark stores are distribution centres that aren’t accessible to the public. These small warehouses efficiently and precisely fill orders, giving customers access to resources and choices, including online shopping, same-day delivery, and in-store pickup.\\\\nThe founders said that the dark store model’s brilliance is how quickly they pick, pack, and ship merchandise. The last mile is similar to every other delivery strategy, though.\\\\nA similar methodology has been used in Western countries, but it has never been investigated in the Indian setting. The “dark store model” eliminates the minor issues that any delivery service experiences, such as traffic jams, connectivity, and navigation. According to Zepto, the network’s performance has improved due to the use of location intelligence, geography, population, road patterns, traffic dynamics, weather, last-mile supply availability, real estate values, and other factors. Additionally, it currently operates over 40 dark stores across several locales.\\\\nDark stores, however, can’t handle high sales volumes because they’re designed for rapid deliveries. Zepto, however, refused to make allowances for this model’s flaws. They have nearly a thousand items on display, including the finest deals on fresh vegetables, milk, meat, and kitchen supplies. Additionally, their AI-powered technologies guarantee a seamless changeover between selecting, packing, and shipping.\\\\nBenefits of Zepto Business Model\\\\n-\\\\nImproved Distribution and faster delivery\\\\nZepto can fulfil orders more swiftly and effectively thanks to the dark store. Micro and cold warehouses offer various distribution options, which also physically deliver groceries closer to a particular market group. Zepto can better regulate the distribution and market spread thanks to this.\\\\n-\\\\nBroader Customer Reach\\\\nThe dark stores make distribution hubs more accessible to customers, and they accept orders 24/7 online. Customers are drawn to these platforms and employ their services as a result.\\\\n-\\\\nContactless Shopping\\\\nThe need for contact-free shopping has primarily influenced businesses’ adoption of the “dark store” strategy. Dark stores enable customers to buy food without interacting with other people or going into a physical store. They put things online and have them delivered right away.\\\\n-\\\\nImproved Inventory Control and Better Product Assortment\\\\nDark stores have no customers, greater inventory control, and can handle higher order quantities. Packers can move as swiftly as possible to pack the things in an order thanks to the dark stores’ convenient navigation. Additionally, Zepto’s AI-powered solutions maintain product assortment and inventory stock tracking.\\\\nZepto’s USPs\\\\nZepto’s business strategy is absolutely focused on providing quick service to customers. Zepto, however, also offers several selling factors that distinguish it from its rivals. Nevertheless, the model also takes these into account.\\\\nZepto is known for its rapid commerce and instant delivery. It claims to have a median delivery time of 8 minutes, 47 seconds and completes grocery deliveries in under 10 minutes.\\\\nAccording to the founders, by the time a user verifies his order, it has already been dispatched for delivery. Additionally, practically all orders are completed in less than 10 minutes, although 1% of them may require 15–16 minutes or even longer.\\\\nZepto offers free shipping. Although this USP pales compared to the first, there are no delivery fees. At the same time, other companies like Instacart, Amazon Fresh, and others charge a delivery fee.\\\\nFree service does not imply more expensive goods. It offers some attractive discounts on the mentioned goods and foods, which is still another USP.\\\\nZepto – Future Plans\\\\nThe Mumbai-based company will use the money to expand its clientele, hire more staff, and open more dark stores in new cities. Bengaluru and the Delhi-National Capital Region have it already, and Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, and Kolkata will get it within the next 30 days.\\\\nIt plans to open 100 dark enterprises by the end of the year, covering about 100 pin codes. By the end of this year, quick commerce is expected to reach $300 million, and by the year 2025, it will grow to $5 billion.\\\\nNo one in India has fully grasped marketing, according to co-founder Palicha. He continued by saying that when you look at a few older organisations who are trying to follow this strategy, you’ll discover that many of them lack the consistency to run on a single model and are unfocused. They engage in various activities, which is the biggest problem in every major company.\\\\n“We have seen our median delivery times stabilise if not decrease, mainly because as we scale our coverage and our expansion, it ends up being a factor of individual cloud stores and how they perform,” he said.\\\\nExpress delivery is not a fresh idea; the majority of current e-grocers have tried it in the past, with varying degrees of success. These platforms have been bringing back quick delivery to customers, especially via the dark-store concept, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic’s quicker acceptance of online groceries.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nZepto has secured $100 million in Series C funding, valued at $570 million, led by Y Combinator’s Continuity Fund. The founders say that investments in Zepto will help it reach more customers and provide them with better service. As of now, Zepto operates in the Indian metros. However, it has not revealed its consumer count, but sources say Zepto is growing at 200% every month.\\\\nAs we mentioned earlier, the 10 min grocery delivery service has disrupted the grocery delivery space. When it became clear that it couldn’t deliver groceries in under 10 minutes, Blinkit (December 2021) announced a temporary suspension of its operation in those locations. While the market leader Swiggy announced a $700 million investment in its grocery delivery business, Swiggy Instamart, and plans to complete deliveries in 15 minutes by January 2022. By the end of Q2 in FY22, Fraazo, a grocery delivery business with headquarters in Mumbai, plans to triple the number of its dark stores to 750. Dunzo and BigBasket are vying to enter the quick-commerce market.\\\\nReturning to Zepto, it takes a mix of a laser-like focus, swift action, and a resilient team. Additionally, it entered the supermarket delivery area at an excellent time.\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto Business Model | How Zepto Makes Money\\\\n🔍InsightsThe convenience of Internet food delivery services was greatly enhanced during the pandemic. The dominant player in the online grocery delivery app and company market is influencing users\\\\\\' habits.\\\\nOnline shopping is becoming increasingly common among consumers. As a result, more and more delivery services, like Zepto, have launched their services to meet the ever-increasing demands of their clients for lightning-fast delivery. You should be familiar with the Zepto business model if you are looking to enter the market.\\\\nThe supermarket delivery industry is booming, thank goodness, because it requires less time, effort, and money than other industries.

This involves setting up delivery-only warehouse-style stores in residential regions. The shops sell a variety of products, and the sole way for buyers to place orders is through the Zepto India website or app. Across multiple regions, Zepto now has more than eighty-six dark storefronts. Dark businesses are great for quick shipping, but they may crash under heavy traffic. However, Zepto created an AI-driven system to assist with selecting, packing, and shipping to avoid sacrificing quality or service. Zepto can provide an extensive product line at rock-bottom prices because of this technology, which guarantees a seamless transition from choosing to packaging to delivery.\\\\nZepto India can provide a fast delivery service thanks to the convenience of having outlets close to customers\\\\\\' homes, which is an advantage of the Zepto business model. The elimination of the necessity for employees to utilize the store also allows the company to run with a reduced headcount.\\\\nHow Zepto Makes Money | Zepto Revenue Model\\\\nA little commission is charged for each order placed using the Zepto Grocery app in India.

This surge in real-time payments not only translated into an estimated $205 million in cost savings for businesses and consumers but also played a pivotal role in unlocking an additional economic output of approximately $US932 million. This substantial contribution represented 0.06% of Australia’s GDP, underscoring the growing significance of real-time payments in driving economic growth.\\\\nReal-time payments are heralded as a significant boon for market efficiency and economic growth, facilitating instant money transfers between parties and eliminating the delays inherent in traditional payment methods. In the same ACI Worldwide report, the Centre for Economic and Business Research notes that real-time payments not only enhance liquidity within the financial system but also serve as a catalyst for economic expansion. This is particularly beneficial for rapidly evolving gig economies, where workers rely on swift payments to manage their finances effectively, and businesses leverage the flexibility offered by real-time transactions to streamline cashflow management. Furthermore, it is also worth noting how most developing nations are at the forefront of real-time payment adoption, leveraging mobile technology to drive significant volume gains. With mobile wallets increasingly integrated with underlying real-time payment systems, both developing and developed markets are poised to witness a transformative shift in payment dynamics.\\\\nAmidst this transformative landscape, Zepto emerges as one of the region’s pioneers, securing the distinction of being Australia’s first non-authorised deposit-taking institution (ADI) approved to directly connect to the New Payments Platform (NPP) as a ‘Connected Institution.’ This accreditation positions Zepto as a trusted infrastructure player, leading the modernisation of payment experiences and establishing a unique foothold in the market.\\\\nLiz Beggs, the COO of Payments Consulting Network, interviewed Chris Jewell, the CEO and Co-Founder of Zepto, to gain insight into the company and its future direction.\\\\nLB: Please provide a brief high-level overview of your business.\\\\nCJ: Zepto is a leading account-to-account [A2A] payments technology platform. We are focused on providing A2A payments capability at a wholesale level. We provide reliable, resilient infrastructure accessibility that enables businesses to pay out, to receive, and to collect in real time through the NPP and the BECS direct entry system. With Australia’s legacy BECS system slated for retirement in 2030, Zepto is uniquely positioned to guide organisations along their payment modernisation journey to the NPP.\\\\nWe began our entrepreneurial journey together as merchants in Byron Bay. After successfully exiting a thriving skydiving business, we set about solving our biggest business frustration: slow, costly, data-blind payments.\\\\nSimply receiving money promptly was an enormous pain point. After navigating the spaghetti mess of fragmented payment offerings, we decided we could do a better job ourselves.\\\\nAnd so, the business that is now called Zepto was born.\\\\nWe recognised early that the combination of real-time payments and insights had incredible potential. From Byron Bay, we set out to build a platform that would enable businesses to get paid in real-time, with precision and tonnes of data. Today, Zepto is a scaling tech company laser-focused on a mission to deliver value for enterprise businesses and their customers through faster, more efficient, secure payments experiences.\\\\nLB: What payment services do you offer merchants and not-for-profit organisations?\\\\nCJ: Zepto creates real-time, A2A payment solutions for business. Money moves into, through, and out of businesses in a myriad of ways. Regardless of verticals or industries, each business has its own unique payment flows.\\\\nEvery day, more businesses understand the impact that A2A payment solutions can have on optimising those flows to deliver internal efficiencies, costs and customer experience. Powering real-time payments between business and customer bank accounts, our technology opens up a unique set of access points into Australia’s A2A payment infrastructure via connections into:\\\\n- New Payment Platform (NPP) – Real Time Payments\\\\n- Bulk Electronic Clearing System (BECS) – Direct Entry\\\\nUsing Zepto’s suite of A2A solutions like it’s enterprise PayID, PayTo, NPP payouts, direct debit and unique Stored Value solution, businesses can confidently make, take and manage data-rich payments directly from their customers’ bank accounts, and have them settle and reconcile instantly 24-7-365. Our core solutions include:\\\\n- PayTo – as the only fintech connected directly to Australia’s real-time payment infrastructure, we offer the benefit of direct-to-the-rail access combined with modern API cloud-based technology.\\\\n- Enterprise PayID – our flagship instant-funds transfer solution supercharges millions of transactions each day with the unique, industry-first capability to activate thousands of PayIDs instantaneously.\\\\n- NPP Payments – enabling our customers to receive and disburse funds in real time on the NPP.\\\\n- Stored Value – you can store funds indefinitely and move them flexibly.\\\\nLB: Are there any particular industry sectors or client groups that you focus on for merchant services?\\\\nCJ: Early last year, we shifted our commercial focus from selling to SME/mid-market customers to engaging enterprise Australia. Over the past 12-months, we’ve been laser-focused on that mission to deliver value for enterprise businesses and their customers through faster, more efficient, secure payments experiences.\\\\nWe are, after all, a trusted infrastructure player modernising enterprise business payment experiences and shaping an entirely new fintech ecosystem through strategic partnerships.\\\\nLB: What do you see as your key strengths with respect to merchant services?\\\\nCJ: At Zepto, we’re all about real-time, making us the ultimate choice for businesses ready to embrace the NPP (PayID, Pay Outs and PayTo).\\\\nAll payment initiations and actions are done via Zepto’s API. This includes Direct Debit (i.e. Payment Requests) via BECS, Payouts via BECS or the NPP, enterprise PayID receivables and PayTo.\\\\nWith Zepto there’s no legacy, no batch processing, just modern enterprise-grade architectures designed for the real time economy. We provide enterprise-grade services without barriers such as high-costs and slow implementation times that are often felt when dealing with legacy payment providers.\\\\nWe pride ourselves on our best-in-class integration framework that includes embedded, dedicated cross-functional project teams to oversee and project manage the integration with our customer’s internal teams, ensuring a collaborative and successful project outcome that is on time and on budget.\\\\nReal time, always-on payments require real time, always-on support. Zepto prides itself on providing best-in-class Customer & Technical Support and Emergency Support, available 24/7/365. Our incident management team includes always having engineers on call who built the software as well as a 100% locally based technical & integration support team.\\\\nLB: What do you see as your key differentiators with respect to merchant services?\\\\nCJ: As the only fintech connected directly to Australia’s real-time payment infrastructure alongside the banks, Zepto offers the benefit of direct access to the payment rails combined with modern API cloud-based technology. This means Zepto provides a superior offering today and enables its enterprise merchant customers to stay at the forefront of any future innovation in account-to-account payments.\\\\nWe are built for real-time. While other fintechs have tried to differentiate themselves by focusing on specific, niche market segments, Zepto’s corner of the payments universe resides at the infrastructure layer within the account-to-account payments space.\\\\nWe have evolved from a traditional fintech into a new breed of financial technology infrastructure or “Finfra” as we like to refer to it. Finfra is a portmanteau of Financial Infrastructure, and we define it as: Fintech agility, accessibility and support underpinned by enterprise grade infrastructure delivering extensibility, security and stability.\\\\nWe are nimble and agile which allows us to respond more quickly to changes in the market, whilst upholding stringent security and compliance standards.\\\\nLB: What were your key achievements over the last 12 months in merchant services?\\\\nCJ: This year, Zepto has been laser-focused on that mission to deliver value for enterprise businesses and their customers through faster, more efficient, secure payments experiences. And we are proud to say that we have delivered on that promise.\\\\nSome of Zepto’s big 2023 wins include:\\\\n- Being selected by Woolworths Group’s Wpay to power its PayTo solution via the New Payments Platform [NPP]. Payment innovators, Zepto and Wpay are working together to offer Australian consumers an instant pay-by-bank-account solution at checkout.\\\\n- Partnering with digital delivery firm OZEDI to devise Australia’s first instant super fund payments solution. This groundbreaking partnership allows Australian businesses to instantly and securely pay contributions to super funds nationally via the NPP with a new PayTo-powered SuperStream service\\\\n- Stored Value – It delivers merchants the flexibility to store, access and move funds precisely the way they need to.\\\\n- In late 2023, Treasury released its second consultation paper on payments licensing reform which contained details of a proposed licensing regime for payments service providers (PSPs). We are proud of our engagement with Treasury in this space and are thrilled to see the real impact our public policy advocacy is having on the future of payments regulation in Australia with Treasury embracing many of the key submissions we made in response to its earlier consultation.\\\\nFrom a product perspective, we delivered a pair of consequential products.\\\\nFirstly, as the first non-bank Connected Institution [CI] to go-live on the real-time payment rails of the NPP, Zepto delivered its directly-connected PayTo solution. The significance of that direct connection cannot be overstated. Paul Monnington, Managing Director of Wpay even shared that our direct connection to the NPP payment rails made us “the obvious choice for us when looking for a PayTo partner.”\\\\nSecondly, we rolled out our Stored Value offering — a digital wallet solution for businesses. This solution enables businesses to store funds indefinitely, move them flexibly, and transform their customer experience and business operations.\\\\nLB: What merchant services innovations do you have on your product/service roadmap for the next 12 months?\\\\nCJ: In 2024, we expect Zepto’s direct connectivity for PayTo to attract more enterprise customers as they comprehend the commercial advantages it can bring. We also expect consumer awareness, comfort and adoption of PayTo as a payment method to gain momentum, driving demand for it on the consumer side. This will inevitably, we believe, lead to more enterprise customer wins and the Zepto team building more industry-first use cases. From real-time payroll and superannuation contributions to PayTo at point-of-sale for Woolworths, we are pioneering new use cases in real-time payments and we expect this to continue to be a focus over the next 12 months.\\\\nWe’re having some great conversations with businesses thinking about how they can build use cases that not only improve back-office efficiencies but that also improve the customer experience, for example, a utility provider not only using PayTo for bill payments but also for bill smoothing to help reduce failed payments and give customers more control and choice of how, and when, they pay.\\\\nWe also expect our customers to leverage our Stored Value capabilities to build bespoke payment experiences for their end customers. Zepto Stored Value allows businesses to securely hold money — theirs or their customers — in a virtual account indefinitely. Those funds can then be moved precisely as required to meet their business and customer needs. Zepto Stored Value connects to all our existing payment rails so that funds can move seamlessly in and out via the New Payments Platform [NPP] or BECS.\\\\nLB: What industry changes or trends to do you see occurring over the next 2-3 years that will have a major impact on your business and/or your clients?\\\\nCJ: Australia stands at the precipice of a financial revolution, with a golden opportunity to position itself as a global leader in payments innovation. At the heart of this evolution is the rising prominence of Australia’s real-time payments infrastructure, the New Payments Platform (NPP), which presents an opportunity to transform Australia’s financial ecosystem, and in turn, our economy.\\\\nIn late 2023, the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia — Michele Bullock, confirmed that the payments industry, through AusPayNet, had set a target date of 2030 for the retirement of Australia’s legacy BECS payments framework. In no uncertain terms now, Australian payments are undergoing once-in-a-generation reform and modernisation.\\\\nWhile credit card payments remain prevalent, the rise in consumers paying by bank account reflects evolving preferences shaped by factors such as cost, security, convenience, and generational shifts in attitudes toward digital banking. As technology continues to advance in the real-time A2A space and consumer preferences evolve, we expect to see continued uptake of ‘pay-by-bank’ payment methods. Businesses need to be thinking about how they are adapting to this trend and where they can embed real-time A2A payments into their payment flows.\\\\nOverall, the adoption of real-time account-to-account payments offers businesses a range of benefits, including improved cash flow, enhanced customer experience, reduced transaction costs, streamlined operations, and better financial visibility. As real-time payment infrastructure continues to evolve and expand globally, businesses stand to gain even more from embracing this technology.\\\\nLB: What key criteria or features should a business consider when evaluating payments service providers?\\\\nCJ: There are several. But here are important ones that need to be on their list.\\\\n- Proximity to the payment rails: Direct connection to the payment rails is the gold standard.\\\\nAsk yourself how many layers of connectivity [and friction] are there between your payments service provider and the underlying payments infrastructure? Every intermediary is a potential impediment to you delivering the seamless payment experiences your customers expect. - Messaging and support: An advantage of direct connection to the payment rails is the real-time flow of data and messaging direct from the source. With every concentric layer of connectivity comes friction and reliance on other parties for data and messaging which, when things go down, is complexity you don’t need.\\\\n- Customer cohort: Has the service provider delivered for businesses like yours before? What kinds of businesses and brands make up the provider’s customer base? These things matter. See if your payments service provider has delivered great solutions and outcomes to businesses of a similar type or scale as yours. Their experience will tell a story worth hearing.\\\\n- Technical infrastructure and platform: Look for highly composable cloud-native technology architectured for scale. Payment providers should be compliant with multiple messaging and security standards like ISO/IEC 27001 for information security management, and ISO 20022 for messaging. Can your payments service provider’s tech integrate with both legacy and modern tech stacks? Not all payments tech was created equal.\\\\n- Culture: Working with a payments service provider is much more than a meeting of technologies. Company culture is vital when assessing how well a provider might be able to collaborate, ideate and deliver the best solution for your business and your customers.\\\\n- Developer experience: When the rubber hits the road, developer experience is everything. APIs should be simple-to-use API and engineered for great developer experience and ease of integration. It’s vital, too, to assess API documentation, API status and uptime, the sandbox environment and — importantly — the help centre.\\\\n- Certifications and licences: Financial services are — justifiably — heavily regulated. So, it’s imperative that your service provider has the requisite licences, certifications and experience to deliver the services they’re offering. Does, for example, your provider have or need an Australian Financial Services Licence?\\\\n- Encryption & Security: Financial data is immensely valuable and therefore attractive to bad actors. Your payment services provider’s persisted data should be encrypted, and there should be a suite of logging, security & intrusion detection monitoring tools enabling real time notifications, administrative UI and automated response plans.\\\\n- Speed & Scale: Modern businesses move fast, and payment flows can flex, surge and peak irregularly. Can your service provider’s platform respond and deliver flawlessly? How quickly, too, can your provider deliver your solution and bring your new offering to market? Do they use tools such as Kubernetes to facilitate rapid deployment, scaling and visibility?\\\\nAuthor: Liz Beggs, Chief Operating Officer, Melbourne, Payments Consulting Network\\\\nLiz Beggs is a versatile and results-focused leader with over 25 years of multi-industry experience in consulting and management.

Well, they are \\\\nnot newbies in the start -up world, this is their third start -up after GoPool and Kiranakart.  They came with \\\\nthis ground-breaking idea while sitting in their homes and waiting for their groceries to be delivered in 2 -3 \\\\ndays. Zepto belongs to those start -up subgroups that experienced meteoric development in the post -\\\\nCovid period. This case explains the developme nt process of how the company is making it possible to \\\\ndeliver items in 10 minutes. Zepto has raised $360 million in funding with the lead investors being the \\\\nAmerican start up accelerator company Y Combinator and the American growth equity firm Glade Broo k \\\\nCapital Partners. Currently, the company has a valuation of $900 million. 1 So, the possibility that Zepto  \\\\nwill soon turn into a unicorn is not a daft idea. However, there is a major concern surrounding Zepto’ s \\\\nbusiness model as they have still not made the business profitable. Zepto is also facing tough \\\\ncompetition from its rival Blinkit (formerly known as Grofers) who was founded in December 2013. \\\\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\\\n \\\\nKeywords: Zepto, Start-up, E-commerce, Business Model, Post-Covid. \\\\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\\\n \\\\nIntroduction \\\\n Zepto is a quick e-commerce company that started its operations in 2021. \\\\n The company started its operations in Bandra, Mumbai and has subsequently extended its \\\\ndelivery areas to Pune, Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Ghaziabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata. \\\\n On October 31, 2021, a total of 8 investors, led by Glade Brook Capital Partners, invested in \\\\nthem $60 million after which more investors began to notice them. Later, they raised additional funding \\\\nthrough their series C and series D rounds. Y Combinator Continuity Fund became the major investor in \\\\nboth of these rounds. \\\\n The Series C and D rounds were held on December 20, 2021 and May 2, 2022 and raised $100 \\\\nmillion and $200 million respectively2.But Zepto is not the only quick commerce start-up that is backed by \\\\nstrong funding, it is up against fierce competition in India from Blinkit. Blinkit has received backing from \\\\n24 investor s and has gone through a total of 19 fundraising rounds. Blinkit is currently valued at $1 \\\\nbillion3. And then there is also Dunzo which is backed by Google. \\\\nZepto’ s tagline is \"Groceries delivered in 10 minutes”. They do this with the help of Dark stores . \\\\nThey are nothing but warehouses that are not open to the public and are located in such area in the \\\\nneighbourhood where demand is high.Only commonly requested commodities are kept in these \\\\nwarehouses, preventing the loss of unsold stock. Zepto’ s dark st ores are designed in a way so that \\\\norders are filled as rapidly as possible, effectively and efficiently reducing time. Currently, Zepto is \\\\ndelivering 2500+ goods, including food and drink, personal care products, fresh produce, home cleaning \\\\nsupplies, and  snacks and beverages, from its 100+ dark stores. As stated by the CEO of zepto  Aadit \\\\nPalicha the average delivery time taken by Zepto is 8 minutes and 47 seconds. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf02a Supervisor, Mentor &Associate Professor, Department of Commerce, Daulat Ram College, University of \\\\nDelhi, Delhi, India. \\\\n**  Student pursuing B.

The company uses artificial intelligence (AI) t o \\\\nenhance the effectiveness of its delivery network by taking into account variables like weather, traffic \\\\npatterns, population, geography, and the availability of last-mile supplies. \\\\n The co-founders have managed to make the roots of the company strong by  getting the best \\\\ntalent out there to work for them when they first started building a team.  They were successful in \\\\npersuading a number of high-profile executives from Dream 11, Amazon, Uber, Pharmeasy, and Flipkart. \\\\n(Source: LinkedIn) \\\\nThese qualified exe cutives have assisted Zepto in achieving unit economics and capital \\\\nefficiency. They are what have allowed Zepto to carve out a place for itself in the grocery’s delivery \\\\nmarket. \\\\nFindings  \\\\nGroceries account for the majority of India\\\\\\'s $1 trillion retail market.1 Consequently, this market \\\\nhas enormous potential. During Corona, it was challenging to leave the house every time you wanted to \\\\nbuy a small essential item, and today with people having to work for long hours, especially in urban cities, \\\\nit is challenging to go out and shop for daily groceries. The market needed an app like Zepto more than it \\\\nwanted one, thus its release was ideal. These apps help customers to save their time  and make their life \\\\neasier. As of right now, as mentioned by the C EO of zepto, they receive 100,000 orders each day, and \\\\ntheir demand curve is essentially flat. They once more turn to technology to determine the ideal location \\\\nfor their tiny fulfilment centres. \\\\nAlthough some would believe that Zepto’ s delivery speed is what sets them apart from the \\\\ncompetition, this is not the case. The key element that sets zepto apart from its rivals is not the quickness \\\\nof the delivery men, but rather how effectively it uses technology. Zepto tracks its customers\\\\\\' spatial data, \\\\ntraffic dynamics, the time it takes to deliver the items, etc. with the aid of www.locus.sh. They collect this \\\\ndata and analyse it to decide whether they need more dark stores in the area to be able to achieve that \\\\n10-minute goal. \\\\nZepto Generates Income in Two Ways \\\\n• It first negotiates a profit margin with the companies based on how much of their product is kept \\\\nin the warehouse. \\\\n• Second, they make money by charging companies for ad space and the top search results. \\\\n• Zepto had total revenue of INR 142.3 Cr in FY22, while incurring costs of INR 532.7 Cr. They \\\\nsuffered a loss of 390.3 Cr INR as a result. \\\\nMarketing costs make up the majority of their spending \\\\nThey invest a lot of money in promoting and advertising their app. During FY22, they spent INR \\\\n175.5 Cr, or almo st 33% of their overall expenses on marketing. In addition to this, the firm spent INR \\\\n213.2 Cr on stock -in-trade purchases in FY22. Employee benefits cost INR 50.3 Cr, while supply chain \\\\ncosts were INR 74 Cr.2 \\\\nZepto’ s EBITDA margin in FY22 was -259.39%.3An EBITDA offers a clear picture of the \\\\ncompany\\\\\\'s worth and displays it to potential buyers and investors. Unfortunately, Zepto’ s EBITDA is \\\\nnegative. \\\\n To distribute the products, Zepto utilizes gig workers. These individuals make an average \\\\nincome of INR 1,30,211.4 \\\\n Zepto has been able to outperform the competition because of its business model. They have a \\\\nhighly effective distribution system, and Zepto’ s AI-powered tools make it simple to manage and keep an \\\\neye on inventory and product selection. This leads to better in ventory management and a wider range of \\\\nproducts. Additionally, they have a large consumer base that is constantly growing. \\\\n \\\\n1  https://www.statista.com/statistics/1021352/india-organized-retail-market-value/https://www.statista.com/topics/5615/food-retail-in \\\\nindia/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20the%20food%20and%20grocery,retail%20market%20at%2063%20percent . \\\\n2  https://www.vccircle.com/zeptounlikely-to-turn-profitable-in-near-term \\\\n3  https://inc42.com/buzz/zepto-incurs-inr-390-cr-loss-in-first-year-of-operations-fy22-sales-at-inr-\\\\n141r/#:~:text=Zepto%2C%20which%20began%20operations%20in,stood%20at%20INR%20140.7%20Cr . \\\\n4  https://www.ambitionbox.com/salaries/zepto-salaries/delivery-boy \\\\x0cDr. Sunita Gupta & Avani Pandey: Just in 10 Minutes: A Case Study on Zepto 195 \\\\nDiscussion \\\\n Zepto is indeed facing losses but it is only natural for a fledgling enterprise in their early years of \\\\noperations to incur some loss.  While Zepto has suffered losses, it is still in a better situation than Blinkit \\\\nand Dunzo, which have suffered losses of INR 1,019 Cr and INR 464 Cr respectively.1 \\\\nThe quick commerce industry has a customer base that is not very devoted, s o even if delivery \\\\ntime increases by a few minutes, customers will still go where they can obtain the best deals. \\\\n Zepto has to strike a balance between discounts and deals and keep their delivery time between \\\\n10 and 20 minutes. Blinkit is their sole main rival at the moment in this market. They need to start \\\\npenetrating into newer cities if they want to distinctly emerge as the leaders of quick commerce. \\\\nZepto has to diversify its revenue streams and stop relying solely on a limited range of sources. \\\\nAccording to the founders of Zepto, they are planning to open a Zepto café that will provide popular \\\\nbrand’s coffee and tea. If it were to become a reality, it may  be successful since metropolitan city\\\\\\'s youth \\\\nrun on caffeine, and hitting up chaayos or blue tokaievery time you feel like drinking one is impractical. If \\\\nZepto wants to make this business a success, they will need more funding. Since Zepto has already \\\\nestablished a reputation for itself and everything associated with that name would benefit from its \\\\ngoodwill, their marketing costs shouldn\\\\\\'t be too high. \\\\nZepto, as well as any other rapid commerce start -up, solely receives criticism for how it treats \\\\ndelivery guys. Due to the shorter time constraints these workers must adhere to, they may drive rashly, \\\\nincreasing the chances of accidents.  Zepto, however, refutes these criticisms by pointing to their \\\\nadvanced technology, which enables the driver to arrive at the destination both securely and on time. \\\\nSWOT Analysis \\\\nStrengths \\\\n• Excellent usage of technology:  With the assistance of www.locus.sh Zepto records its \\\\ncustomers\\\\\\' geographical data, traffic dynamics, delivery time, and so on. They gather and \\\\nevaluate this data to determine whether more dark establishments are needed in the region to \\\\nmeet the 10-minute objective. \\\\n• Being true to their objective:  Zepto ensures that their customers\\\\\\' expectations are met by \\\\ndelivering goods in 10 minutes. Zepto achieves their ai m 90% of the time, which contributes to \\\\nbrand loyalty. \\\\n• Strong financial support:  Zepto is well -funded, which allows it to expand and grow into a \\\\nmarket leader. They currently have a total funding of $360 million. \\\\n• Competent Workforce: The effective management of Zepto is in the hands of highly skilled and \\\\nexperienced professionals. They are Zepto’ s most valuable resource since they are well -\\\\ninformed about the market. Palicha and Vohra, the co -founders, did a fantastic job in creating \\\\ntheir team. \\\\nWeakness \\\\n• Reliance on retailers: Zepto’s business strategy is primarily dependent on other businesses \\\\nand their inventory. When a retailer\\\\\\'s stock is unavailable, customers may be forced to select a \\\\nhigher-priced substitution or go without buying that item from them. \\\\n• Fluctuating customer base:  To keep their clientele, Zepto must find a balance between their \\\\ndiscount strategy and keeping their delivery time under 10 minutes. \\\\n• Net Income: Zepto’s operational costs are high. They need to grow their sales while decreasing  \\\\nsome of their expenditures to make their business profitable. \\\\n• Nothing Unique: Zepto’s business strategy is not very unique, and any company may enter this \\\\nmarket and replicate it. \\\\n \\\\n1  https://www.vccircle.com/blinkits-marketplace-arm-s-fy22-loss-widens-to-over-rs-1-000-\\\\ncrore#:~:text=Blinkit\\\\\\'s%20marketplace%20arm\\\\\\'s%20FY22%20loss%20widens%20to%20over%20Rs%201%2C000%20crore, -\\\\nBy%20Malvika%20Maloo&text=Zomato%2Downed%20Blinkit\\\\\\'s%20marketplace%20arm,on%20transportation%2C%20contract%\\\\n20and%20advertising. \\\\nhttps://inc42.com/buzz/dunzos-loss-widens-2x-to-inr-464-cr-in-fy22-as-expenses-also-double/#:~:text=Share%20story-\\\\n,Dunzo\\\\\\'s%20Loss%20Widens%202X%20To%20INR%20464,FY22%20As%20E xpenses%20Also%20Double&text=Bengaluru%2\\\\nDbased%20hyperlocal%20delivery%20platform,due%20to%20doubling%20of%20expenses . \\\\n \\\\x0c196 International Journal of Advanced Research in Commerce, Management & Social Science (IJARCMSS)  -October-December, 2022 \\\\nOpportunity \\\\n• Infiltrating further into existing locations and entering fresh  cities: One way they can \\\\noutperform their competitors is to grow their business as quickly as possible. \\\\n• Various Business Ventures:  Zepto has developed a brand identity for itself, which they can \\\\nnow utilize to enter into other sectors and diversify their revenue stream. \\\\nThreats \\\\nHeavy competition: Zepto is in a league with big names. Customers swing from one app to the \\\\nnext like a pendulum. Because there is little consumer loyalty, Zepto must continually stay on top of their \\\\ngame. \\\\n Exploitation of delivery boys: There are several sceptics of the quick commerce industry. \\\\nDelivery boys are exploited in the name of quick delivery and are subjected to extreme strain, increasing \\\\nthe likelihood of an accident. \\\\nConclusion  \\\\nSince its start in April 2021, Zepto has grown organically to become one of India\\\\\\'s most valuable \\\\nand promising start -ups. Zepto has everything a successful firm requires: a talented and dedicated \\\\nworkforce, solid funding, and the use of technology to operate rapidly. However, they cannot handle huge \\\\nsales volume since the dark stores they utilise for speedy delivery are not built to support large scale \\\\noperations. They  keep a limited number of fresh items in hand because if they are not sold, they will \\\\nsuffer losses as the items stale. As a result , there is a possibility that the consumer use competitor\\\\\\'s app \\\\nsince the things they want are out of stock. \\\\nOn the face of it, if Blinkit exists& grows, it is difficult for Zepto  to be the market leader. Both \\\\nhave a nearly identical business model, and Bl inkit’ s delivery time is also less than 10 minutes so \\\\nactually they both don’t have anything unique that sets them apart. The only thing that can help Zepto to \\\\ncompete with Blinkit and become a stable business firm is expanding into more cities and having  a wider \\\\nrange of products to pick from. \\\\nZepto along with other apps is effectively breaking the mould of traditional purchasing and \\\\nestablishing an e-consumerism habit. There is no doubt that Zepto is now expanding faster than anybody \\\\nelse in this sector. They are detail-oriented and employ AI-based technologies well. \\\\nZepto is expected to become a unicorn in 2023. 1However, being a unicorn does not imply that \\\\nthe firm is profitable. \\\\nIn the FY22 their revenue was considerable, as seen by the number of orders they received \\\\neach day, but their operational costs were high and  hence they suffered losses. If they want to become a \\\\nprofitable firm, they must expand into newer cities while adhering to their basic principles and finding \\\\nmethods to reduce their operational expenses. \\\\nReferences  \\\\n1. https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto/news \\\\n2. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto \\\\n3. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zepto-29b1 \\\\n4. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/grofers-trusted-delivery-partner \\\\n5.

Offering a diverse range of high-quality products, including groceries, fresh produce, household items, and personal care products, Zepto ensures customer satisfaction and encourages repeat business. The introduction of private-label products enhances brand loyalty by providing quality at competitive prices, making Zepto a compelling choice in the fast-paced online grocery landscape.\\\\nPrice\\\\nZepto adopts a strategic pricing strategy to enhance its market position by offering competitive pricing that attracts customers and ensures a sustainable market share. The company uses dynamic pricing to adjust its prices in response to demand and competition, thus optimizing revenue and profitability. Moreover, Zepto actively engages customers through various promotional offers, including discounts and coupons, aimed at not only drawing new patrons but also fostering loyalty and encouraging repeat business.\\\\nPlace\\\\nZepto primarily operates through its mobile app, which is designed to make grocery ordering quick and easy for busy customers. The company has strategically located dark stores to ensure speedy and efficient order fulfillment. Zepto has also partnered with a variety of delivery services to guarantee that orders are delivered promptly to customers\\\\\\' doorsteps. This integrated approach demonstrates Zepto\\\\\\'s dedication to providing convenience and efficiency in the grocery delivery industry. Zepto\\\\\\'s business strategy revolves around offering ultra-fast delivery, with a focus on customer convenience and satisfaction.\\\\nPromotion\\\\nZepto employs a diverse marketing approach, utilizing digital channels like social media and influencer marketing, alongside out-of-home advertising for brand visibility. Positive media coverage enhances its reputation, while meme marketing fosters audience engagement. A referral program incentivizes customer loyalty, contributing to both acquisition and retention. Zepto\\\\\\'s concise and varied strategies solidify its dynamic presence in the market.\\\\nZepto Target Audience\\\\nZepto mainly targets busy people living in cities who want quick grocery deliveries. Its customers include young professionals, students, and families who need things fast. The service is for people who like using technology to save time. Zepto focuses on city areas, offering a simple online shopping experience.\\\\nZepto Marketing Strategy\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s marketing strategy has played a crucial role in growing its business to this extent. A lot of innovative steps have been taken by the company to support and boost its business growth. Zepto\\\\\\'s target audience is generally young adults and the modern generation. Here is the detailed overview you must read.\\\\n10-Mins Delivery Strategy\\\\nThe idea of online grocery delivery is not new. Startups like Dunzo and Blinkit are already providing these services. The fact that distinguishes Zepto from all its competitors is its 10-minute delivery of groceries and other products. You might have heard about Zomato Instant, which provides food delivery within 10 minutes, but Zepto is the first player in the grocery delivery segment to offer a 10-minute grocery delivery service.\\\\nThe idea of 10-minute grocery delivery is unique, but it was not that easy to implement. To fulfill its promise to deliver groceries in the specified time, Zepto introduced the concept of the dark store model. The dark store is like a fulfillment center for Zepto; it is not accessible to the public but is efficient enough to fulfill orders rapidly.\\\\nArtificial intelligence is used by Zepto to pick, pack, and transport orders in leaps and bounds. Whenever any customer places an order, a person with a tablet is assigned to pick up and pack the order within 60 seconds. It means that at the time you make the payment, someone is already preparing your order for dispatch. The company claims that 8 minutes and 40 seconds is the average delivery time they have achieved.\\\\nZepto operates its dark store delivery within a 3 km radius, and it doesn\\\\\\'t penalize its delivery boy for late delivery.\\\\nDiscounts are a way to attract customers, but as a new player in the segment, offering huge discounts was not a sustainable option for Zepto. Hence, the 10-minute delivery strategy comes out to be a panacea for Zepto.\\\\nAdvertising and Branding Strategy\\\\nThere is not only one thing responsible for the success of Zepto, but an incredible advertising strategy has also played an important role in the success. L&K Saatchi and Saatchi is an advertising agency that was assigned to advertise Zepto and build a strong brand image in front of consumers. The main theme of all the ads is to emphasize the 10-minute delivery of Zepto.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s ads are attention-grabbing ads that suddenly capture the focus, and this is what every brand wants. When a boy suddenly wakes up and runs toward the door, it creates a question in the minds of viewers about why he is running. The twist and excitement of the ad make it capable of grabbing the attention of viewers.\\\\nIf I try to summarize the above ad in a single sentence, then it is like this: From the time you wake up until the time you sleep, every essential product will get delivered to your doorstep within 10 minutes.\\\\nEach ad that was created is meant to make the consumer feel how Zepto is capable of changing their daily grocery shopping habit. Since advertising is the best way to market the product and build a strong brand image, Zepto has fully utilized the benefits of marketing.\\\\nAdvertising was not only done on social media channels, but it also planted its hoardings in the streets of cities in which Zepto\\\\\\'s services are operational.\\\\nSocial Media Meme Marketing\\\\nIn today\\\\\\'s generation of technology and innovation, we cannot ignore the power of social media. There is a huge chance you\\\\\\'ll find your target audience on the social media platform. Hence, every brand is focusing on social media marketing. Zepto is also not behind the race; it leverages the social platform to engage its audience through meme marketing.\\\\nFor the recently released movie \\\\\\'Avatar: The Way of Water,\\\\\\' Zepto created a meme to grab the consumer\\\\\\'s attention by following the ongoing trend. It\\\\\\'s just one example, but if you visit Zepto\\\\\\'s social media page, you\\\\\\'ll find plenty of such memes.\\\\nMeme marketing is a trend today because people often share memes with their loved ones. This will help the brand get some organic reach and, at the same time, promote the brand. Zepto knows the power of memes very well. That\\\\\\'s why if you open their page on any platform like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, you\\\\\\'ll find amazing memes.\\\\nTh has gained a lot of positive feedback from customers. Along with meme marketing, they sometimes collaborate with famous social media influencers to make videos for them. This tactic helps to create a loyal fanbase and also helps the brand image flourish.\\\\nMicro-Moments Marketing Strategy\\\\nMicro-moments are key moments in a customer\\\\\\'s journey where brands can influence buying decisions. Zepto understands this and focuses on sending the right messages at the right time to connect with customers. Studies show that over 150 billion mobile micro-moments happen every day, influencing more than 70% of purchases. Brands using this approach see a 74% success rate in increasing revenue.\\\\nCustomer Acquisition and Retention Strategy\\\\nPlayers in the quick commerce industry like Dunzo, Swiggy Instamart, and Blinkit are well-funded and established. These big giants have already acquired a huge market share in the segment by offering huge discounts and other offers. So it was not easy for Zepto to acquire customers and retain them.\\\\nDiscounts are not the only things that attract consumers. Consumers are always hungry for something new, and exactly here, Zepto played its game. Acquisition of customers and retaining customers are two different things. Other players in the segment have easily acquired customers but struggled to retain them.\\\\nCustomers are used to switching platforms and ordering items from the app, where the discount is heavy. In the case of Zepto, it has given discounts and at the same time provided high-speed free delivery. It helps to enhance Zepto\\\\\\'s retention rate significantly.\\\\nNo other players in the segment were making that fast delivery. This eventually leads to an increase in Zepto\\\\\\'s consumer base.\\\\nDigital Marketing\\\\nZepto uses digital marketing to reach busy customers with fast and targeted ads. They focus on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook to promote quick delivery and special offers. Zepto also uses precision messaging or micro-moments to engage customers when they are likely to make a purchase. Through online campaigns, Zepto builds brand awareness and encourages customers to use their service for fast grocery deliveries.\\\\nReferral Programs\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s referral program plays a crucial role in its successful marketing strategy. The program offers unique codes to its users for sharing, which incentivizes both existing and new users with rewards such as discounts. This helps in cost-effective customer acquisition and increases customer retention. The program\\\\\\'s seamless integration with social media, multiple reward options, and gamification elements make it a dynamic and impactful tool for Zepto\\\\\\'s growth and customer loyalty.\\\\nBeyond transactional benefits, Zepto\\\\\\'s referral initiative is a brand-building powerhouse, fostering advocacy and community engagement. By creating a positive customer experience and utilizing word-of-mouth influence, the program stands as a testament to the brand\\\\\\'s commitment to customer satisfaction and strategic marketing prowess.\\\\nPartnerships with Influencers\\\\nZepto partners with social media influencers who create authentic content to showcase its services. This helps Zepto build trust, connect with specific audiences, and reach more customers. This approach has fueled rapid growth, with the company raising over $300 million in just one year, emphasizing its focus on long-term customer relationships.\\\\nMarketing Campaign of Zepto\\\\nboAt, India’s leading audio brand, has teamed up with Zepto to bring high-quality audio products to your doorstep in just 10 minutes. This partnership combines boAt’s top-notch audio expertise with Zepto’s quick delivery, making it easier to enjoy music, movies, podcasts, and more. Whether it\\\\\\'s a party, a podcast, or binge-watching, boAt and Zepto ensure the perfect audio experience is just a tap away.\\\\nA marketing campaign is an integral part of any brand\\\\\\'s effort to increase its visibility and create brand awareness. The same is true for Zepto. In the IPL 2022, Zepto created and ran a marketing campaign that truly had a new approach.\\\\nMost of the time, we have faced the issue of time stretching in different places like airports, hospitals, and restaurants. Because we usually wait for a long time in these places, it became quite common for us, but Zepto addressed this issue and showcased it in its campaign in such a way that, at the same time, it also represented the 10-minute delivery promise of Zepto.\\\\nIn this campaign, three famous singers—Shankar Mahadevan, Usha Uthup, and Kailash Kher—have given their incredible voices. Three ads have been created for this campaign with the voices of these three singers. They have stretched the time with their voices in such a way that it shows our habit of waiting. At the same time, Zepto implements its tagline of 10-minute delivery.\\\\nL&K Saatchi and Saatchi created this campaign very beautifully, and the whole marketing campaign turned out to be a huge success for Zepto.\\\\nIn this brand campaign, Zepto has come up with a significant collaboration featuring renowned cricketer Jasprit Bumrah as the brand ambassador. Developed by L&K Saatchi & Saatchi, the \\\\\\'Groceries delivered at Bumrah Speed\\\\\\' campaign embodies speed, precision, consistency, and rigor. This initiative not only introduces Indian audiences to cutting-edge special effects but also promises an experience comparable to the grandeur of cinema.\\\\nThe campaign\\\\\\'s focal point will be on Disney+ Hotstar, other leading OTT platforms, Zepto\\\\\\'s application, social media channels, and various digital platforms. Outdoor advertising will be prominently displayed across major cities where Zepto operates, ensuring widespread visibility and engagement.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s \\\\\\'Nahi Milega\\\\\\' brand campaign underscores its commitment, emphasizing that while life may present unattainable challenges, unlimited free deliveries on Zepto are certain.\\\\nZepto adopted an unconventional approach by introducing Uncle Ji, a character from Delhi, several weeks before unveiling their brand campaign. The intention was to disrupt social media with Uncle Ji\\\\\\'s distinctive personality, straightforward expressions of reality, and the recurring catchphrase \\\\\\'Nahi Milega\\\\\\' (won\\\\\\'t be available).\\\\nZepto said Uncle Ji\\\\\\'s character achieved remarkable organic traction, accumulating 10 million impressions with a substantial 10% engagement rate across all social media platforms. Uncle Ji trended at #6 on Twitter and received endorsements from popular Twitter celebrities and Instagram meme pages, solidifying his status as a cultural icon in India.\\\\nZepto USP\\\\nZepto’s business model focuses on customers and offers instant delivery, setting it apart from competitors. The app is known for being the fastest, delivering groceries in as little as 10 minutes, with a claimed average time of 8 minutes and 47 seconds. When users place an order, it\\\\\\'s already on its way. Zepto also offers free shipping, unlike Amazon Fresh and Instacart, which charge delivery fees. Despite offering free delivery, Zepto doesn\\\\\\'t raise product prices and provides great discounts on groceries.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nZepto is a young startup, and it has achieved this success in a short period of time because of its incredible marketing strategy.

Therefore, how can the delivery sector lag? The delivery sector is going through a lot of changes every day. Different delivery apps and startups are bringing in other methods.\\\\nIn this blog today, we will discuss the marketing strategy of Zepto – one of the most prominent grocery delivery apps of the present time. The best part of Zepto marketing strategy is the 10-minute guarantee delivery. As a result, you can get groceries delivered to your doorstep that you previously purchased from the local general store.\\\\nWhat is Zepto? What Types of Companies Comes Under the Zepto Marketing Strategy?\\\\nZepto offers service only through the official application. At present, it has more than 80 dark stores throughout the country. These stores are primarily in tier one cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, and more. Zepto is a pan-India company that started its operations in April 2021. However, it was founded in September 2020.\\\\nThe primary reason Zepto has a successful business model in India is that Zepto marketing strategy includes producing 2500+ goods within 10 minutes. As a result, it was impossible for any top delivery or e-commerce sites.\\\\nWhether it is the marketing strategy of Zepto or any other marketing strategy, there are a lot of crucial factors. The idea is one of the most important ones of them. The Story of Zepto starts when the two founders, who were studying computer science, got tempted with their creative idea to start a business.\\\\nWith the idea to deliver food to your doorsteps in the least possible time, Zepto was introduced. The most crucial thing was that Zepto was introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the strict lockdown, when people were striving hard to get out of their homes, the founders worked hard to make the delivery possible even during the restrictions.\\\\nHow does Zepto Delivery Work? A Detail on Zepto Business Model\\\\nThe Zepto business model was inspired by the idea on which KiranaKart depends. KiranaKart depends on is for the local shopkeepers and managers. They deliver the goods and products within 45 minutes of placing the order. Zepto marketing strategy is based on similar ideas. Both the founders were bachelors, and they had to struggle a lot to get food delivered. This is where they got the idea of creating such an app that quickly provides grocery items.\\\\nAlso Read: 8 Compelling Reasons to Invest in a Grocery App Development Company\\\\nTheir vision is to open Zepto Dark stores all over India and expand the brand at the top level. They are planning to increase the team from 400 to 800 by 2023. You must think that Zepto app is the only company to be the fastest delivery online shopping app. At the same time, they are facing intense competition from rival companies like Swiggy, Zomato, Blinkit and Dunzo. The best part is all the competitors are offering the same service at equal rates.\\\\nTherefore, it was not easy to stay in the top place. Zepto marketing strategy required more business skills and investment to be the fastest delivery app in India. They introduced new standards to transform their work in the delivery infrastructure – right from the basic level. In simple words, ground-level work was still needed.\\\\nFunding & Investment for Zepto Marketing Strategy\\\\nThe leading sources for Zepto’s funds are Y combinator community funds and Glade brook capital partners. Both invested 100 million dollars and 4.4 billion rupees, respectively. Zepto has a successful business model in India, showing continuous growth. You can see the Zepto marketing strategy’s success from the number of stores they have opened across cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune and more.\\\\nAs the fastest delivery app in India, Zepto delivers grocery items only in the stores’ available areas. The technical office is in Bangalore. This is where all the technicalities are handled, while the operations are done from the Mumbai office. So, if you ask if the supermarket business is profitable in India, we will say YES. Why? Popular apps like Flipkart, Uber, Dream11 and more have their key executives in the Zepto app. Recently, Lazypay and Pescafresh partnered with Zepto.\\\\nZepto Talent Acquisition\\\\nAnother important thing that has worked in favour of a successful Zepto marketing strategy is acquiring talent. Top executives decided to join Zepto because it allowed so many people that had shifted to Bangalore to come back to Mumbai. However, the fast growth of the start-up, its ambition and the disciplined execution encouraged several people to be attracted to the company.\\\\nOrder Volume Claims\\\\nBlinkit & Instamart claimed that their weekly order volume increased to more than a million. So, the question is, what about Zepto? How many orders are they delivering now? Well, Zepto is not too keen to publish the numbers. However, they are saying that with the current numbers, they shall easily surpass the competitors in the market.\\\\nZepto Business Model: Dark Store Model\\\\nDark stores might seem a sinister option, but it is a great idea that helped multiple retail businesses stay afloat throughout the pandemic. The dark stores are distribution outlets that are not open to visitors. These are micro warehouses that quickly and accurately fulfil orders. Therefore, they offer shoppers resources and options like buying products online, pickup in-store and same-day delivery.\\\\nAccording to the founders and shareholders of the Zepto app, the magic of the dark store model is how they became the fastest delivery app in India. With the help of the dark stores, they could pick, pack, and dispatch the goods within 60 seconds. However, the last section is just like any other delivery model.\\\\nSuch a grocery delivery model is implemented in developed nations; however, the model was never explored in India. The dark store model reduces the trivial challenges that any delivery service faces. These include navigation, traffic congestion, and connectivity.\\\\nZepto marketing strategy used geography, location intelligence, population, road patterns, traffic dynamics, last-minute supply availability, weather, real estate values and others. All these factors improved the network’s overall performance.\\\\nDark stores are meant for instant deliveries and can’t handle the sales volume. However, the Zepto grocery app didn’t compromise on the shortcomings of this model. They have thousands of products on display, fresh produce, meat, milk, kitchen refills and more at the best bargain. Also, the AI-powered tool ensures a smooth transition, right from picking, packing, and delivering. All these features make the Zepto grocery app the fastest online shopping app.\\\\nBenefits of Zepto Business Model\\\\nThere are a lot of benefits to the Zepto Business Model. In the following section of the blog, we shall mention a few.\\\\n1. Better Distribution & Faster Delivery\\\\nThe dark store enables Zepto to fulfill orders quickly and more efficiently. In addition, the micro and cold warehouses offer several distribution choices and bring groceries closer to a particular market segment. Thus, you can see that Zepto has higher control over the market spread and distribution. It is another reason why Zepto is the fastest delivery app in India.\\\\n2. Better and Broader Customer Reach\\\\nOne of the dark stores’ most important features is bringing the distribution centres close to the consumers. The best thing about these stores is they are always online to take orders. It is what brings consumers to such platforms and uses their services. Therefore, it is one of the essential features that made the successful Zepto marketing strategy.\\\\n3. Contactless Shopping\\\\nThere is no denying the fact that the need for contact-free shopping is a critical factor for businesses to adopt the “dark store” approach. The dark stores allow consumers to purchase groceries in a contactless way without entering a physical store. All you must do is place orders, and you will get them instantly.\\\\n4. Better Inventory Control and Product Assortment\\\\nZepto’s business model and Zepto marketing strategy worked because they chose dark stores. The dark stores are customer-free zones, and they have better control over the inventory. Therefore, they can easily manage larger order volumes. In addition, the dark stores are designed to ensure easy navigation, allowing the packers to move quickly to pack the items in an order. Also, the AI-powered tools keep the inventory stock track and provide product assortment.\\\\nZepto’s USP\\\\nZepto’s business model is customer-centric, and it is an instant delivery model. However, Zepto offers a few selling points that set it apart from its competitors. Still, these are also included in the model.\\\\nOne of the main reasons the Zepto app is the fastest online shopping app is because Zepto has instant delivery and is regarded as quick commerce. They are capable enough to fulfill the grocery delivery in 10 minutes. Also, they claim to have a delivery time of 8 minutes and 47 seconds.\\\\nAccording to the founders, when a user checks the order, it is already shipped out for delivery. Therefore, it is another essential element that makes Zepto marketing strategy successful. They fulfill almost every order within 10 minutes. Only one percent of the charges might take 15-16 minutes.\\\\nAnother crucial factor for successful business models in India is to offer free shipping. Zepto offers free shipping. Even though this USP has got dim compared to the former one, it still doesn’t charge a delivery fee. On the other hand, Amazon Fresh & Instacart have delivery fees.\\\\nYou must remember that the free service doesn’t mean costlier products. Yet another USP is that it offers excellent discounts on its list of products and groceries.\\\\nZepto’s Online Ad Campaigns\\\\nZepto marketing campaigns are one of the best ones you shall see in the ad campaigns of recent companies. Zepto witnessed growth primarily because of its unique ad campaigns online. All of this they achieved in a short time. Did you know? L&K Saatchi & Saatchi was behind 3 of Zepto’s recent ads.\\\\nThe idea behind all Zepto’s ad campaigns is that time is an expandable commodity in India. Therefore, you cannot afford to waste it. Whether you must board a flight or wait for the food at a restaurant, we all have experienced stretchable time. It is where Zepto ad campaigns have stood apart.\\\\nHere are examples of the Zepto marketing strategy ad campaign where they surprisingly used three famous singers. Usha Uthup, Shankar Mahadevan & Kailash Kher are cast in unusual roles where they must stretch time in their way – thus highlighting the objective of Zepto, which is on-time delivery.\\\\nThe ad campaigns have paved the way for the Zepto app to be the most talked about brand.\\\\nHere’s What Zepto’s Chief Marketing Officer has to Say\\\\nAmritansu Nanda, Chief Marketing Officer of Zepto, says, “Our consumers lead busy, fast-paced lives. At Zepto, through our on-time delivery promise and at the back of our exceptional tech, we constantly strive to let them know and reassure them that we value their time.

Zepto is a case in point. From scripting these to presenting them to producing them, working on the campaign was an absolute pleasure, with the agency and client working as one team completely committed to the product. I think the results speak for themselves.\\\\nIn Conclusion\\\\nZepto marketing strategy has helped the brand to grow as the fastest delivery app in India. Zepto app has plans to expand into newer cities as quickly as possible. They are also planning to increase their coverage to micro-markets and be the leaders in the sector. Several other competitors are trying to participate in the market and grow quickly. However, they cannot promise things like 10-minute delivery consistently.

Well, they are \\\\nnot newbies in the start -up world, this is their third start -up after GoPool and Kiranakart.  They came with \\\\nthis ground-breaking idea while sitting in their homes and waiting for their groceries to be delivered in 2 -3 \\\\ndays. Zepto belongs to those start -up subgroups that experienced meteoric development in the post -\\\\nCovid period. This case explains the developme nt process of how the company is making it possible to \\\\ndeliver items in 10 minutes. Zepto has raised $360 million in funding with the lead investors being the \\\\nAmerican start up accelerator company Y Combinator and the American growth equity firm Glade Broo k \\\\nCapital Partners. Currently, the company has a valuation of $900 million. 1 So, the possibility that Zepto  \\\\nwill soon turn into a unicorn is not a daft idea. However, there is a major concern surrounding Zepto’ s \\\\nbusiness model as they have still not made the business profitable. Zepto is also facing tough \\\\ncompetition from its rival Blinkit (formerly known as Grofers) who was founded in December 2013. \\\\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\\\n \\\\nKeywords: Zepto, Start-up, E-commerce, Business Model, Post-Covid. \\\\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\\\n \\\\nIntroduction \\\\n Zepto is a quick e-commerce company that started its operations in 2021. \\\\n The company started its operations in Bandra, Mumbai and has subsequently extended its \\\\ndelivery areas to Pune, Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Ghaziabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata. \\\\n On October 31, 2021, a total of 8 investors, led by Glade Brook Capital Partners, invested in \\\\nthem $60 million after which more investors began to notice them. Later, they raised additional funding \\\\nthrough their series C and series D rounds. Y Combinator Continuity Fund became the major investor in \\\\nboth of these rounds. \\\\n The Series C and D rounds were held on December 20, 2021 and May 2, 2022 and raised $100 \\\\nmillion and $200 million respectively2.But Zepto is not the only quick commerce start-up that is backed by \\\\nstrong funding, it is up against fierce competition in India from Blinkit. Blinkit has received backing from \\\\n24 investor s and has gone through a total of 19 fundraising rounds. Blinkit is currently valued at $1 \\\\nbillion3. And then there is also Dunzo which is backed by Google. \\\\nZepto’ s tagline is \"Groceries delivered in 10 minutes”. They do this with the help of Dark stores . \\\\nThey are nothing but warehouses that are not open to the public and are located in such area in the \\\\nneighbourhood where demand is high.Only commonly requested commodities are kept in these \\\\nwarehouses, preventing the loss of unsold stock. Zepto’ s dark st ores are designed in a way so that \\\\norders are filled as rapidly as possible, effectively and efficiently reducing time. Currently, Zepto is \\\\ndelivering 2500+ goods, including food and drink, personal care products, fresh produce, home cleaning \\\\nsupplies, and  snacks and beverages, from its 100+ dark stores. As stated by the CEO of zepto  Aadit \\\\nPalicha the average delivery time taken by Zepto is 8 minutes and 47 seconds. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf02a Supervisor, Mentor &Associate Professor, Department of Commerce, Daulat Ram College, University of \\\\nDelhi, Delhi, India. \\\\n**  Student pursuing B.

The company uses artificial intelligence (AI) t o \\\\nenhance the effectiveness of its delivery network by taking into account variables like weather, traffic \\\\npatterns, population, geography, and the availability of last-mile supplies. \\\\n The co-founders have managed to make the roots of the company strong by  getting the best \\\\ntalent out there to work for them when they first started building a team.  They were successful in \\\\npersuading a number of high-profile executives from Dream 11, Amazon, Uber, Pharmeasy, and Flipkart. \\\\n(Source: LinkedIn) \\\\nThese qualified exe cutives have assisted Zepto in achieving unit economics and capital \\\\nefficiency. They are what have allowed Zepto to carve out a place for itself in the grocery’s delivery \\\\nmarket. \\\\nFindings  \\\\nGroceries account for the majority of India\\\\\\'s $1 trillion retail market.1 Consequently, this market \\\\nhas enormous potential. During Corona, it was challenging to leave the house every time you wanted to \\\\nbuy a small essential item, and today with people having to work for long hours, especially in urban cities, \\\\nit is challenging to go out and shop for daily groceries. The market needed an app like Zepto more than it \\\\nwanted one, thus its release was ideal. These apps help customers to save their time  and make their life \\\\neasier. As of right now, as mentioned by the C EO of zepto, they receive 100,000 orders each day, and \\\\ntheir demand curve is essentially flat. They once more turn to technology to determine the ideal location \\\\nfor their tiny fulfilment centres. \\\\nAlthough some would believe that Zepto’ s delivery speed is what sets them apart from the \\\\ncompetition, this is not the case. The key element that sets zepto apart from its rivals is not the quickness \\\\nof the delivery men, but rather how effectively it uses technology. Zepto tracks its customers\\\\\\' spatial data, \\\\ntraffic dynamics, the time it takes to deliver the items, etc. with the aid of www.locus.sh. They collect this \\\\ndata and analyse it to decide whether they need more dark stores in the area to be able to achieve that \\\\n10-minute goal. \\\\nZepto Generates Income in Two Ways \\\\n• It first negotiates a profit margin with the companies based on how much of their product is kept \\\\nin the warehouse. \\\\n• Second, they make money by charging companies for ad space and the top search results. \\\\n• Zepto had total revenue of INR 142.3 Cr in FY22, while incurring costs of INR 532.7 Cr. They \\\\nsuffered a loss of 390.3 Cr INR as a result. \\\\nMarketing costs make up the majority of their spending \\\\nThey invest a lot of money in promoting and advertising their app. During FY22, they spent INR \\\\n175.5 Cr, or almo st 33% of their overall expenses on marketing. In addition to this, the firm spent INR \\\\n213.2 Cr on stock -in-trade purchases in FY22. Employee benefits cost INR 50.3 Cr, while supply chain \\\\ncosts were INR 74 Cr.2 \\\\nZepto’ s EBITDA margin in FY22 was -259.39%.3An EBITDA offers a clear picture of the \\\\ncompany\\\\\\'s worth and displays it to potential buyers and investors. Unfortunately, Zepto’ s EBITDA is \\\\nnegative. \\\\n To distribute the products, Zepto utilizes gig workers. These individuals make an average \\\\nincome of INR 1,30,211.4 \\\\n Zepto has been able to outperform the competition because of its business model. They have a \\\\nhighly effective distribution system, and Zepto’ s AI-powered tools make it simple to manage and keep an \\\\neye on inventory and product selection. This leads to better in ventory management and a wider range of \\\\nproducts. Additionally, they have a large consumer base that is constantly growing. \\\\n \\\\n1  https://www.statista.com/statistics/1021352/india-organized-retail-market-value/https://www.statista.com/topics/5615/food-retail-in \\\\nindia/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20the%20food%20and%20grocery,retail%20market%20at%2063%20percent . \\\\n2  https://www.vccircle.com/zeptounlikely-to-turn-profitable-in-near-term \\\\n3  https://inc42.com/buzz/zepto-incurs-inr-390-cr-loss-in-first-year-of-operations-fy22-sales-at-inr-\\\\n141r/#:~:text=Zepto%2C%20which%20began%20operations%20in,stood%20at%20INR%20140.7%20Cr . \\\\n4  https://www.ambitionbox.com/salaries/zepto-salaries/delivery-boy \\\\x0cDr. Sunita Gupta & Avani Pandey: Just in 10 Minutes: A Case Study on Zepto 195 \\\\nDiscussion \\\\n Zepto is indeed facing losses but it is only natural for a fledgling enterprise in their early years of \\\\noperations to incur some loss.  While Zepto has suffered losses, it is still in a better situation than Blinkit \\\\nand Dunzo, which have suffered losses of INR 1,019 Cr and INR 464 Cr respectively.1 \\\\nThe quick commerce industry has a customer base that is not very devoted, s o even if delivery \\\\ntime increases by a few minutes, customers will still go where they can obtain the best deals. \\\\n Zepto has to strike a balance between discounts and deals and keep their delivery time between \\\\n10 and 20 minutes. Blinkit is their sole main rival at the moment in this market. They need to start \\\\npenetrating into newer cities if they want to distinctly emerge as the leaders of quick commerce. \\\\nZepto has to diversify its revenue streams and stop relying solely on a limited range of sources. \\\\nAccording to the founders of Zepto, they are planning to open a Zepto café that will provide popular \\\\nbrand’s coffee and tea. If it were to become a reality, it may  be successful since metropolitan city\\\\\\'s youth \\\\nrun on caffeine, and hitting up chaayos or blue tokaievery time you feel like drinking one is impractical. If \\\\nZepto wants to make this business a success, they will need more funding. Since Zepto has already \\\\nestablished a reputation for itself and everything associated with that name would benefit from its \\\\ngoodwill, their marketing costs shouldn\\\\\\'t be too high. \\\\nZepto, as well as any other rapid commerce start -up, solely receives criticism for how it treats \\\\ndelivery guys. Due to the shorter time constraints these workers must adhere to, they may drive rashly, \\\\nincreasing the chances of accidents.  Zepto, however, refutes these criticisms by pointing to their \\\\nadvanced technology, which enables the driver to arrive at the destination both securely and on time. \\\\nSWOT Analysis \\\\nStrengths \\\\n• Excellent usage of technology:  With the assistance of www.locus.sh Zepto records its \\\\ncustomers\\\\\\' geographical data, traffic dynamics, delivery time, and so on. They gather and \\\\nevaluate this data to determine whether more dark establishments are needed in the region to \\\\nmeet the 10-minute objective. \\\\n• Being true to their objective:  Zepto ensures that their customers\\\\\\' expectations are met by \\\\ndelivering goods in 10 minutes. Zepto achieves their ai m 90% of the time, which contributes to \\\\nbrand loyalty. \\\\n• Strong financial support:  Zepto is well -funded, which allows it to expand and grow into a \\\\nmarket leader. They currently have a total funding of $360 million. \\\\n• Competent Workforce: The effective management of Zepto is in the hands of highly skilled and \\\\nexperienced professionals. They are Zepto’ s most valuable resource since they are well -\\\\ninformed about the market. Palicha and Vohra, the co -founders, did a fantastic job in creating \\\\ntheir team. \\\\nWeakness \\\\n• Reliance on retailers: Zepto’s business strategy is primarily dependent on other businesses \\\\nand their inventory. When a retailer\\\\\\'s stock is unavailable, customers may be forced to select a \\\\nhigher-priced substitution or go without buying that item from them. \\\\n• Fluctuating customer base:  To keep their clientele, Zepto must find a balance between their \\\\ndiscount strategy and keeping their delivery time under 10 minutes. \\\\n• Net Income: Zepto’s operational costs are high. They need to grow their sales while decreasing  \\\\nsome of their expenditures to make their business profitable. \\\\n• Nothing Unique: Zepto’s business strategy is not very unique, and any company may enter this \\\\nmarket and replicate it. \\\\n \\\\n1  https://www.vccircle.com/blinkits-marketplace-arm-s-fy22-loss-widens-to-over-rs-1-000-\\\\ncrore#:~:text=Blinkit\\\\\\'s%20marketplace%20arm\\\\\\'s%20FY22%20loss%20widens%20to%20over%20Rs%201%2C000%20crore, -\\\\nBy%20Malvika%20Maloo&text=Zomato%2Downed%20Blinkit\\\\\\'s%20marketplace%20arm,on%20transportation%2C%20contract%\\\\n20and%20advertising. \\\\nhttps://inc42.com/buzz/dunzos-loss-widens-2x-to-inr-464-cr-in-fy22-as-expenses-also-double/#:~:text=Share%20story-\\\\n,Dunzo\\\\\\'s%20Loss%20Widens%202X%20To%20INR%20464,FY22%20As%20E xpenses%20Also%20Double&text=Bengaluru%2\\\\nDbased%20hyperlocal%20delivery%20platform,due%20to%20doubling%20of%20expenses . \\\\n \\\\x0c196 International Journal of Advanced Research in Commerce, Management & Social Science (IJARCMSS)  -October-December, 2022 \\\\nOpportunity \\\\n• Infiltrating further into existing locations and entering fresh  cities: One way they can \\\\noutperform their competitors is to grow their business as quickly as possible. \\\\n• Various Business Ventures:  Zepto has developed a brand identity for itself, which they can \\\\nnow utilize to enter into other sectors and diversify their revenue stream. \\\\nThreats \\\\nHeavy competition: Zepto is in a league with big names. Customers swing from one app to the \\\\nnext like a pendulum. Because there is little consumer loyalty, Zepto must continually stay on top of their \\\\ngame. \\\\n Exploitation of delivery boys: There are several sceptics of the quick commerce industry. \\\\nDelivery boys are exploited in the name of quick delivery and are subjected to extreme strain, increasing \\\\nthe likelihood of an accident. \\\\nConclusion  \\\\nSince its start in April 2021, Zepto has grown organically to become one of India\\\\\\'s most valuable \\\\nand promising start -ups. Zepto has everything a successful firm requires: a talented and dedicated \\\\nworkforce, solid funding, and the use of technology to operate rapidly. However, they cannot handle huge \\\\nsales volume since the dark stores they utilise for speedy delivery are not built to support large scale \\\\noperations. They  keep a limited number of fresh items in hand because if they are not sold, they will \\\\nsuffer losses as the items stale. As a result , there is a possibility that the consumer use competitor\\\\\\'s app \\\\nsince the things they want are out of stock. \\\\nOn the face of it, if Blinkit exists& grows, it is difficult for Zepto  to be the market leader. Both \\\\nhave a nearly identical business model, and Bl inkit’ s delivery time is also less than 10 minutes so \\\\nactually they both don’t have anything unique that sets them apart. The only thing that can help Zepto to \\\\ncompete with Blinkit and become a stable business firm is expanding into more cities and having  a wider \\\\nrange of products to pick from. \\\\nZepto along with other apps is effectively breaking the mould of traditional purchasing and \\\\nestablishing an e-consumerism habit. There is no doubt that Zepto is now expanding faster than anybody \\\\nelse in this sector. They are detail-oriented and employ AI-based technologies well. \\\\nZepto is expected to become a unicorn in 2023. 1However, being a unicorn does not imply that \\\\nthe firm is profitable. \\\\nIn the FY22 their revenue was considerable, as seen by the number of orders they received \\\\neach day, but their operational costs were high and  hence they suffered losses. If they want to become a \\\\nprofitable firm, they must expand into newer cities while adhering to their basic principles and finding \\\\nmethods to reduce their operational expenses. \\\\nReferences  \\\\n1. https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto/news \\\\n2. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto \\\\n3. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zepto-29b1 \\\\n4. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/grofers-trusted-delivery-partner \\\\n5.

Dwell up the tech world with my glasses :)\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto, a quick-commerce startup founded in 2021 by Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, has disrupted the Indian grocery delivery market with its promise of delivering essentials within 10 minutes. The company has rapidly scaled up to become one of the most recognized names in the ultra-fast grocery delivery segment. In this article, we’ll take a deep dive into Zepto’s business model, revenue streams, and the strategies that fuel its success.\\\\nZepto’s Business Model Overview\\\\nZepto operates on a quick-commerce (q-commerce) model, which focuses on delivering groceries and daily essentials to customers in ultra-short time frames. Unlike traditional grocery e-commerce players, Zepto’s unique selling point lies in its 10-minute delivery promise. Here’s how its model is structured:\\\\na. Dark Stores\\\\n- Zepto operates a network of dark stores, which are small warehouses strategically located in densely populated urban areas.\\\\n- These dark stores are optimized for speed, with AI and machine learning used to ensure efficient inventory management, storage, and order fulfillment.\\\\n- The proximity of these dark stores to customer locations enables the company to meet its delivery promises.\\\\nb. Hyperlocal Delivery\\\\n- Zepto uses a hyperlocal delivery model, which involves sourcing products from dark stores closest to the customer.\\\\n- Its algorithm-based delivery system ensures optimal route planning and efficient utilization of delivery personnel.\\\\nc. App-Based Ordering\\\\n- The Zepto app is designed for simplicity, allowing users to quickly browse, select, and order from a wide range of groceries and essentials.\\\\n- The app also personalizes the shopping experience by leveraging customer data to recommend frequently purchased items.\\\\nZepto Key Revenue Streams\\\\nDespite offering free or low-cost delivery to customers, Zepto has built a strong revenue model. Here’s how the company earns money:\\\\na. Product Margins\\\\n- Zepto earns revenue through the sale of groceries and daily essentials. The company procures goods directly from manufacturers, wholesalers, and distributors at lower prices, allowing it to enjoy healthy margins on most products.\\\\n- Its dark store model ensures cost efficiency, as these warehouses are located in less expensive real estate areas compared to retail spaces.\\\\nb. Delivery Charges\\\\n- While Zepto offers free delivery for orders above a certain threshold, it charges a delivery fee for smaller orders. This fee helps cover operational and logistics costs.\\\\n- In addition, Zepto has experimented with subscription-based delivery models, offering unlimited free deliveries for a monthly or annual fee.\\\\nc. Advertising and Promotional Listings\\\\n- Zepto monetizes its platform by allowing brands to advertise and promote their products. This includes:\\\\n- Featured listings on the app.\\\\n- Banner advertisements for specific brands or products.\\\\n- These promotions help brands gain visibility and increase sales, while Zepto earns a commission for the space and exposure provided.\\\\nd. Private Label Products\\\\n- Zepto has introduced its private label brands, offering staples like rice, pulses, and cooking oil under its own label. These products yield higher profit margins compared to third-party goods and help build customer loyalty.\\\\ne. Data Monetization\\\\n- By collecting and analyzing customer data, Zepto generates valuable insights on buying patterns, preferences, and demand trends. While this isn’t a direct revenue stream currently, it offers long-term monetization opportunities through partnerships with FMCG brands and suppliers.\\\\nKey Features of Zepto’s Strategy\\\\nZepto’s success can be attributed to its strategic focus on operational efficiency and customer experience. Here are the core elements of its strategy:\\\\na. Technology-Driven Operations\\\\n- Zepto leverages advanced technology, including AI and machine learning, to optimize inventory, manage supply chains, and predict demand.\\\\n- The company’s algorithm ensures that products are stocked in the right quantities and locations, minimizing wastage and ensuring availability.\\\\nb. Strategic Location of Dark Stores\\\\n- Dark stores are located in high-demand areas, ensuring that they can cater to a radius of 1–3 kilometers. This proximity to customers is critical for meeting the 10-minute delivery promise.\\\\nc. Focus on Speed and Convenience\\\\n- Speed is the cornerstone of Zepto’s business model. Orders are processed immediately after being placed, and delivery riders are assigned based on proximity and route optimization.\\\\n- The app’s user-friendly interface adds to the convenience factor, ensuring repeat purchases.\\\\nd. Diverse Product Offering\\\\n- Zepto offers a wide range of products, from fresh produce and groceries to personal care items, snacks, and beverages. This variety ensures that it meets diverse customer needs.\\\\nZepto’s Financial Performance\\\\nZepto has demonstrated impressive growth in a short span of time. As of the latest updates:\\\\n- Revenue Growth: Zepto reported robust revenue growth, driven by an increase in repeat customers and higher order volumes.\\\\n- Burn Rate: Like many startups in the q-commerce space, Zepto operates at a high burn rate due to marketing, operations, and delivery costs. However, the company is focused on achieving profitability by optimizing operations and increasing average order values.\\\\nChallenges Faced by Zepto\\\\nDespite its rapid success, Zepto faces several challenges:\\\\n- High Competition: Players like Blinkit (Zomato-owned), Swiggy Instamart, and Dunzo are fierce competitors in the quick-commerce space, offering similar services.\\\\n- Logistics Costs: Maintaining a fleet of delivery personnel and managing dark store operations require significant investment.\\\\n- Customer Retention: As the novelty of 10-minute delivery wears off, retaining customers with value-added services and competitive pricing becomes crucial.\\\\n- Regulatory Scrutiny: The quick-commerce industry has faced criticism for putting undue pressure on delivery personnel, raising concerns about safety and labor practices.\\\\nFuture Prospects and Growth Strategies\\\\nZepto has ambitious plans for the future, including:\\\\n- Geographical Expansion: The company is expanding its footprint in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, tapping into the growing demand for convenience.\\\\n- New Product Categories: Zepto is exploring new categories like electronics and pharmacy to diversify its offerings.\\\\n- Sustainability Initiatives: The company is working on reducing packaging waste and introducing eco-friendly delivery practices.\\\\n- AI and Automation: Continued investment in technology will help Zepto improve operational efficiency and lower costs.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nZepto’s business model is a testament to the growing demand for quick commerce in urban India. By focusing on speed, technology, and customer convenience, the company has carved out a unique space in the competitive grocery delivery market. While challenges like high operational costs and intense competition remain, Zepto’s innovative strategies and focus on customer satisfaction position it as a strong contender in the evolving q-commerce landscape.

This substantial growth is expected to surpass other markets, including China, in terms of quick commerce adoption.\\\\nAs their standard of living increases and their daily schedules get tighter, consumers are flocking to customized and convenient internet platforms for grocery shopping instead of walking down to the local shops.\\\\nFollowing the COVID-19 pandemic, the popularity of online grocery delivery became increasingly evident. As a consequence of social distancing constraints, consumers are converting to online grocery shopping, which is not only convenient but also safer.\\\\nZepto - Founders and Team\\\\nAadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, both 19-year-old childhood pals, founded Zepto after walking out of Stanford University\\\\\\'s renowned computer science department to return to their home country, India, and start up a business. The Zepto company began its operations in April 2021.\\\\nKaivalya Vohra\\\\nKaivalya Vohra is the CTO and Co-Founder of Zepto. He was also the founder and CTO of KiranaKart. He also attended Stanford University to pursue a degree in Computer Science, but like Aadit, he decided to leave the university. Kaivalya, along with Aadit, participated in Y Combinator as well.\\\\nAadit Palicha\\\\nAadit Palicha is the CEO and Co-Founder of Zepto. He was also the founder and CEO of KiranaKart. After completing an IB diploma from GEMS Education in Mathematics and Computer Science, Palicha then went for a Bachelor\\\\\\'s degree in Computer Science from Stanford University, however, he quit the program in the middle to launch his firm. Aadit then completed Y Combinator Grade: W21 and started with PryvaSee as a Project Lead. Aadit Palicha then founded GoPool, his first startup, when he was just 17. He left the same in April 2020 and founded KiranaKart and then Zepto.\\\\nFlaunt your startup with StartupTalky\\\\n800+ stories, thousands of founders, and millions of visitors.

Inviting founders and startups who are building sustainable solutions from ground zero! Startups who run the show, StartupTalky will let the world know!\\\\nZepto - Startup Story\\\\nMany of us have \"startup ideas,\" but even the most creative among us struggle to see them through. Palicha and Vohra had both enrolled at Stanford to earn a Computer Science degree but had dropped out to follow their business passions instead.\\\\nThe story of Zepto started during the COVID-19 outbreak. The concept for Zepto sprang from the limitations of their houses. A surge in demand for delivery services meant that groceries and other necessities would arrive in a couple of days, creating a void for quick delivery. As a result, Zepto was created with all this insight.\\\\nThese teenagers were abruptly detained, because of Covid norms, detained in their Mumbai homes after significant collaboration on many projects, including a ride-hailing commuting app for kids. Even while grocery delivery, which was deemed important by local authorities, was still permitted across much of the nation as the virus spread, the duo battled to get their provisions as the illness expanded.\\\\nWhile Zepto is the focus of attention, Palicha and Vohra\\\\\\'s first venture, KiranaKart, did not receive the same acclaim. Zepto, on the other hand, is inspired by KiranaKart. KiranaKart, as its name implies, was a supermarket delivery service. It had made arrangements with Kirana merchants to provide groceries in 45 minutes or less. A $730,000 pre-seed round was led by Global Founders Capital, 2 AM Ventures, Contrary Capital, and angel investors. At the time, Vohra and Palicha planned to make the first 1.5 lakh deliveries for INR 1.\\\\nZepto - Mission and Vision\\\\nAs two bachelors living alone, the founders found it most difficult to obtain food, therefore, they focused their applications on grocery delivery. So, whereas KiranaKart, their first startup, tried to make grocery delivery easier for Kiranas, Zepto aims to shorten delivery times.\\\\nZepto - Name, Logo, and Tagline\\\\nThe firm, which uses the term \"Zepto\" to denote \"a factor of 10⁻²¹, i.e. 0.000000000000000000001,\" named after a minuscule unit of time, offers a 10-minute grocery delivery service, surpassing numerous well-funded competitors.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s tagline says, \"Groceries delivered in 10 minutes\".\\\\nZepto - Business and Revenue Model\\\\nZepto delivers groceries in ten minutes through a system of dark storefronts and mini-warehouses, on up to 90% of orders. Zepto works in the quick commerce segment of India. It is designed to be customer-centric and built around the instant service model.\\\\nTo ensure a flawless delivery experience, Aadit says that their average delivery time is 8 minutes and 47 seconds. Through a chain of dark stores or retail distribution centers, the Mumbai-based company employs a hotspot method to cater largely to digital purchases.\\\\nA dark store is a tiny neighborhood storehouse that customers cannot visit but purchase online to get packaged delivery. While dark stores are not new to the Indian industry, Aadit believes that the idea has yet to be completely explored. Population, traffic dynamics, topography, road patterns, weather conditions, last-mile operational improvement, real estate prices, and other geographic data and local intelligence aid Zepto in optimizing its connectivity. Furthermore, the startup\\\\\\'s dark warehouses and cool rooms are custom-designed to satisfy particular criteria such as ease of travel, allowing packers to move as swiftly as possible to fill orders.\\\\nLocation intelligence and geographic data, such as topography, population, road patterns, traffic dynamics, weather, last-mile supply availability, real estate values, and so on, are said to help Zepto optimize its network.\\\\nZepto - Funding and Investors\\\\nZepto, the Mumbai-based quick commerce unicorn, achieved unicorn status in August 2023 after raising $200 million in a Series E funding round, which brought its valuation to $1.4 billion. This milestone marked the end of India\\\\\\'s 11-month unicorn drought. The Series E round was led by The StepStone Group, with participation from Goodwater Capital and existing investors.\\\\nIn June 2024, Zepto raised $665 million, which valued the company at $3.6 billion. Just a few months later, on August 30, 2024, Zepto raised $340 million in Series G funding, which increased its valuation to $5 billion. The Series G round was led by General Catalyst, with Dragon Fund and Epiq Capital joining as new investors. Existing backers such as StepStone, Lightspeed, DST, and Contrary also increased their investments, reflecting strong confidence in Zepto\\\\\\'s growth potential.\\\\nIn November 2024, Zepto raised another $350 million from a group of domestic investors, led by Motilal Oswal\\\\\\'s private wealth division, at a flat valuation of $5 billion. This brings the total funding raised by Zepto to $2 billion.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s initial seed funding in September 2020 was led by Contrary.\\\\n| Date | Round | Amount | Lead Investors |\\\\n|---|---|---|---|\\\\n| November 21, 2024 | Series G | $350 | Motilal Oswal Wealth |\\\\n| August 30, 2024 | Series G | $340 million | General Catalyst, Mars Growth Capital |\\\\n| June 21, 2024 | Series F | $665 million | Glade Brook Capital Partners, Nexus Venture Partners, StepStone Group |\\\\n| Nov 8, 2023 | Series E | $31.3 million | Goodwater Capital, Nexus Venture Partners |\\\\n| Aug 25, 2023 | Series E | $200 million | StepStone Group |\\\\n| May 2, 2022 | Series D | $200 million | Y Combinator Continuity Fund |\\\\n| Dec 20, 2021 | Series C | $100 million | Y Combinator Continuity Fund |\\\\n| Oct 31, 2021 | Series B | $60 million | Glade Brook Capital Partners |\\\\n| Mar 22, 2021 | Series A | $6.5 million | Nexus Venture Partners |\\\\n| Sep 1, 2020 | Pre Seed Round | - | Contrary |\\\\nZepto - Shareholding\\\\nZepto shareholding pattern as of October 2024 (source: Tracxn):\\\\n| Zepto Shareholders | Percentage |\\\\n|---|---|\\\\n| Aadit Palicha | 0.9% |\\\\n| Kaivalya Vohra | 0.7% |\\\\n| Nexus Venture Partners | 18.6% |\\\\n| Glade Brook Capital | 10.3% |\\\\n| StepStone Group | 9.8% |\\\\n| Y Combinator | 8.7% |\\\\n| LGF Scale I | 7.8% |\\\\n| Rocket Internet | 3.0% |\\\\n| General Catalyst | 4.1% |\\\\n| Goodwater Capital | 1.8% |\\\\n| Razor\\\\\\'s Edge Ventures | 1.6% |\\\\n| Contrary | 1.6% |\\\\n| Kaiser Permanente | 2.3% |\\\\n| avra | 1.3% |\\\\n| SpringBlue Capital | 1.0% |\\\\n| Lightspeed Venture Partners | 0.8% |\\\\n| Global Founders Capital | 0.8% |\\\\n| Crimson | 0.5% |\\\\n| Vanderbilt University | 0.3% |\\\\n| Mangum | 0.3% |\\\\n| Bayhouse Capital | 0.2% |\\\\n| Mehta Ventures | <0.1% |\\\\n| Contrary Capital | <0.1% |\\\\n| Zpt Holdings | 2.1% |\\\\n| AZ04 | 1.4% |\\\\n| Kiranakart SPV | 0.6% |\\\\n| Sayacorps | 0.4% |\\\\n| C Opportunities | 0.1% |\\\\n| Jung Lish Lee | 2.3% |\\\\n| Oliver Jung | 0.7% |\\\\n| Oleg Wladimir Nicolas Tscheltzoff | 0.2% |\\\\n| Aditi Javesh Jhaveri | <0.1% |\\\\n| Manoj Chawla | <0.1% |\\\\n| Kavit Dilip Palicha | 8.0% |\\\\n| Jaideep Vohra | 6.7% |\\\\n| Other Investors | 1.0% |\\\\nAmong the shareholders, Nexus Venture Partners holds the largest stake, holding 18.6% of Zepto. Other prominent owners of Zepto include Y Combinator, Glade Brook Capital, StepStone Group, and co-founders Aadit Palicha (along with Kavit Dilip Palicha) and Kaivalya Vohra (along with Jaideep Vohra), among others.\\\\nZepto - IPO\\\\nZepto plans to go public in 2025. To prepare for its IPO, the company set up a new entity, Zepto Marketplace Private Limited, in October 2024 to simplify its operations. Zepto currently operates under a B2B model, sourcing products directly from brands and selling them to its partner companies, which then distribute the products to customers under a licensing agreement.\\\\nIn January 2025, Zepto completed its domicile shift from Singapore to India ahead of its IPO, which is now expected to raise between $800 million and $1 billion, including secondaries. Initially, the company targeted a $450 million primary capital raise.\\\\nZepto has hired Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Axis Capital as advisors for the IPO. This marks a key step in its journey as a leader in the quick commerce industry.\\\\nZepto - Growth and Revenue\\\\nZepto has seen impressive growth, serving 10 major cities with 1,000+ employees. They deliver more than 5,000 products, revolutionizing the Indian grocery segment with 10-minute delivery, advanced tech, and optimized centers.\\\\nEngineering, operations, marketing, and financial positions are also available at Zepto. Palicha claims that month-over-month growth is 200%, with a monthly retention rate of 78%.\\\\n“We are looking at a pretty crazy runrate,” he said. “In the past one and a half months, we have grown our business by 10 times. And now we are working to grow another 10 times by February or March,” said Palicha in December 2021.\\\\nZepto, when it was a five-month-old startup, had secured a valuation of $570 million after raising $100 million in a Series C round headed by Y Combinator\\\\\\'s Continuity Fund, which was a 2X increase from its previous valuation of $60 million only 45 days before that. Zepto raised another round led by Y Combinator to lift its valuation further to $900 million, so there is certainly impressive growth that the company has received in funding as well.\\\\nAnother positive development for Zepto has been the expertise it has been able to acquire. Plenty of well-known senior executives from Uber, Flipkart, Dream11, Amazon, and Pharmeasy have joined the team.\\\\nAccording to Palicha, one of the reasons why several entrepreneurs have chosen Zepto is that it has enabled individuals who had transferred from Mumbai to Bangalore to come back to their homes. He says, nevertheless, that the startup\\\\\\'s rapid development, rigorous execution, and ambitions have captivated others who share his interests. \"We\\\\\\'ve been able to walk the walk,\" he said.\\\\n“They originally launched with a different model, swiftly pivoted to quick commerce in August 2021 and are now adding 100,000 new customers every week, 60% of them women. Their attention to detail on the logistics experience is unparalleled and this has enabled them to scale to most major metros in just 5 months. Simply put, we’re confident Zepto will win in this space over the long-term,\" said Anu Hariharan, a partner at Y Combinator, in a statement.\\\\nZepto has demonstrated significant growth in recent times, with the majority of its dark stores now operating profitably. According to co-founder and CEO Aadit Palicha, Zepto has successfully established its presence in major metro cities in India with over 300-400 dark stores. Impressively, approximately 50–60 percent of these dark stores have started generating cash flows, indicating the effectiveness of Zepto\\\\\\'s business model and operational strategies. This noteworthy achievement highlights Zepto\\\\\\'s commitment to sustainable growth and profitability in the fiercely competitive quick-commerce industry.\\\\nZepto Financials\\\\n| Zepto Financials | FY22 | FY23 | FY24 |\\\\n|---|---|---|---|\\\\n| Operating Revenue | INR 142.3 crore | INR 2,026 crore | INR 4,454 crore |\\\\n| Expenses | INR 532.7 crore | INR 3,350 crore | INR 5,754 crore |\\\\n| Profit/Loss | INR 390.3 crore (loss) | INR 1,272 crore (loss) | INR 1,248 crore (loss) |\\\\nIn FY23, the quick-commerce startup’s operating revenue stood at INR 2,026 crore. In FY24, Zepto\\\\\\'s operating revenue saw a growth of about 120%, reaching INR 4,454 crore.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s losses saw a slight decrease of 2% in FY24, to INR 1,248.6 crore from INR 1,272 crore in FY23.\\\\nExpenses\\\\nIn FY24, Zepto\\\\\\'s total expenses saw a massive rise of 71.6%, reaching INR 5,747 crore, up from INR 3,350 crore in FY23.\\\\nZepto’s gross merchandise volume (GMV) surpassed $1 billion (INR 8,300 crore) in FY24, marking a significant milestone. The company also reported a 140% year-on-year growth, with 75% of its dark stores achieving full EBITDA positivity by May 2024.\\\\nZepto - Challenges\\\\nZepto has encountered some challenges lately, and in one of the recent ones, there were instances of founder and investor impropriety within the quick commerce delivery startup. Ansh Nanda, an alleged co-founder of the startup said that he was forced to relinquish his stakes in the startup by the other cofounders and by Nexus Ventures. This was carried forward by Nanda, who lodged an FIR against the cofounders of Zepto and the Nexus Ventures partner, Suvir Sujan. However, the co-founders responded to the same without much delay by approaching the Delhi High Court. Zepto is the third startup that is backed by Nexus and where one of the co-founders has been named in an FIR. YoloBus and Acko were two other companies that dealt with the same before.\\\\nZepto - Advertisements and Social Media Campaigns\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s marketing strategy has been a key driver of its rapid growth in the quick-commerce industry. The creative brilliance of L&K Saatchi & Saatchi was evident in three earlier ads promoting Zepto\\\\\\'s products and services.\\\\nBuilding on this success, Zepto continued to impress with new campaigns featuring celebrated singers like Kailash Kher, Shankar Mahadevan, and Usha Uthup during the IPL season of 2022. These unique and melodic campaigns resonated with audiences, boosting Zepto\\\\\\'s visibility and brand appeal.\\\\nFurthermore, the launch of the \"Nahi Milega\" campaign in March 2023, featuring the character \"Uncle Ji,\" highlighted unlimited free deliveries, solidifying Zepto\\\\\\'s position as the go-to platform for ultra-fast and cost-effective grocery delivery. With an innovative approach and successful marketing initiatives, Zepto has emerged as a leading player in the competitive quick-commerce industry, catering to the needs of time-conscious consumers.\\\\nZepto - Competitors\\\\nMany businesses compete with Zepto and have already been driving fast-paced delivery of groceries like:\\\\n- Swiggy Instamart\\\\n- Blinkit\\\\n- Big Basket\\\\nDunzo is another startup, that uses its Xpress Mart dark shop network to deliver groceries in Bengaluru in 19 minutes and competes with Zepto.\\\\nZepto - Future Plans\\\\nZepto currently operates in major cities across India, including Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Ghaziabad, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, and Kolkata. The company has ambitious plans to multiply its dark stores and expand its delivery network with profitability in focus.\\\\nZepto has sped up its store expansion, increasing its target from 700 to 1,200 stores by March 2025. With over 650 outlets in operation as of January 2025, the company is strengthening its presence in the quick commerce space.\\\\nA new key driver of Zepto’s growth is its food and beverage division, Zepto Café, which is currently in 15% of its dark stores. With an estimated ARR of INR 160 crore, Zepto Café is expanding rapidly, adding over 100 outlets monthly and targeting an INR 1,000 crore revenue run rate by FY26.\\\\nThe company is projecting gross sales of $5.5 billion in the final quarter of FY26, with an aim to achieve positive EBITDA (excluding ESOPs).\\\\nThe ultimate goal is to become a publicly listed company.

This integrated approach demonstrates Zepto\\\\\\'s dedication to providing convenience and efficiency in the grocery delivery industry. Zepto\\\\\\'s business strategy revolves around offering ultra-fast delivery, with a focus on customer convenience and satisfaction.\\\\nPromotion\\\\nZepto employs a diverse marketing approach, utilizing digital channels like social media and influencer marketing, alongside out-of-home advertising for brand visibility.

Its customers include young professionals, students, and families who need things fast. The service is for people who like using technology to save time.

A lot of innovative steps have been taken by the company to support and boost its business growth. Zepto\\\\\\'s target audience is generally young adults and the modern generation. Here is the detailed overview you must read.\\\\n10-Mins Delivery Strategy\\\\nThe idea of online grocery delivery is not new. Startups like Dunzo and Blinkit are already providing these services. The fact that distinguishes Zepto from all its competitors is its 10-minute delivery of groceries and other products. You might have heard about Zomato Instant, which provides food delivery within 10 minutes, but Zepto is the first player in the grocery delivery segment to offer a 10-minute grocery delivery service.\\\\nThe idea of 10-minute grocery delivery is unique, but it was not that easy to implement. To fulfill its promise to deliver groceries in the specified time, Zepto introduced the concept of the dark store model. The dark store is like a fulfillment center for Zepto; it is not accessible to the public but is efficient enough to fulfill orders rapidly.\\\\nArtificial intelligence is used by Zepto to pick, pack, and transport orders in leaps and bounds. Whenever any customer places an order, a person with a tablet is assigned to pick up and pack the order within 60 seconds. It means that at the time you make the payment, someone is already preparing your order for dispatch. The company claims that 8 minutes and 40 seconds is the average delivery time they have achieved.\\\\nZepto operates its dark store delivery within a 3 km radius, and it doesn\\\\\\'t penalize its delivery boy for late delivery.\\\\nDiscounts are a way to attract customers, but as a new player in the segment, offering huge discounts was not a sustainable option for Zepto. Hence, the 10-minute delivery strategy comes out to be a panacea for Zepto.\\\\nAdvertising and Branding Strategy\\\\nThere is not only one thing responsible for the success of Zepto, but an incredible advertising strategy has also played an important role in the success. L&K Saatchi and Saatchi is an advertising agency that was assigned to advertise Zepto and build a strong brand image in front of consumers. The main theme of all the ads is to emphasize the 10-minute delivery of Zepto.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s ads are attention-grabbing ads that suddenly capture the focus, and this is what every brand wants. When a boy suddenly wakes up and runs toward the door, it creates a question in the minds of viewers about why he is running. The twist and excitement of the ad make it capable of grabbing the attention of viewers.\\\\nIf I try to summarize the above ad in a single sentence, then it is like this: From the time you wake up until the time you sleep, every essential product will get delivered to your doorstep within 10 minutes.\\\\nEach ad that was created is meant to make the consumer feel how Zepto is capable of changing their daily grocery shopping habit. Since advertising is the best way to market the product and build a strong brand image, Zepto has fully utilized the benefits of marketing.\\\\nAdvertising was not only done on social media channels, but it also planted its hoardings in the streets of cities in which Zepto\\\\\\'s services are operational.\\\\nSocial Media Meme Marketing\\\\nIn today\\\\\\'s generation of technology and innovation, we cannot ignore the power of social media. There is a huge chance you\\\\\\'ll find your target audience on the social media platform. Hence, every brand is focusing on social media marketing. Zepto is also not behind the race; it leverages the social platform to engage its audience through meme marketing.\\\\nFor the recently released movie \\\\\\'Avatar: The Way of Water,\\\\\\' Zepto created a meme to grab the consumer\\\\\\'s attention by following the ongoing trend. It\\\\\\'s just one example, but if you visit Zepto\\\\\\'s social media page, you\\\\\\'ll find plenty of such memes.\\\\nMeme marketing is a trend today because people often share memes with their loved ones. This will help the brand get some organic reach and, at the same time, promote the brand. Zepto knows the power of memes very well. That\\\\\\'s why if you open their page on any platform like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, you\\\\\\'ll find amazing memes.\\\\nTh has gained a lot of positive feedback from customers. Along with meme marketing, they sometimes collaborate with famous social media influencers to make videos for them. This tactic helps to create a loyal fanbase and also helps the brand image flourish.\\\\nMicro-Moments Marketing Strategy\\\\nMicro-moments are key moments in a customer\\\\\\'s journey where brands can influence buying decisions. Zepto understands this and focuses on sending the right messages at the right time to connect with customers. Studies show that over 150 billion mobile micro-moments happen every day, influencing more than 70% of purchases. Brands using this approach see a 74% success rate in increasing revenue.\\\\nCustomer Acquisition and Retention Strategy\\\\nPlayers in the quick commerce industry like Dunzo, Swiggy Instamart, and Blinkit are well-funded and established. These big giants have already acquired a huge market share in the segment by offering huge discounts and other offers. So it was not easy for Zepto to acquire customers and retain them.\\\\nDiscounts are not the only things that attract consumers. Consumers are always hungry for something new, and exactly here, Zepto played its game. Acquisition of customers and retaining customers are two different things. Other players in the segment have easily acquired customers but struggled to retain them.\\\\nCustomers are used to switching platforms and ordering items from the app, where the discount is heavy. In the case of Zepto, it has given discounts and at the same time provided high-speed free delivery. It helps to enhance Zepto\\\\\\'s retention rate significantly.\\\\nNo other players in the segment were making that fast delivery. This eventually leads to an increase in Zepto\\\\\\'s consumer base.\\\\nDigital Marketing\\\\nZepto uses digital marketing to reach busy customers with fast and targeted ads. They focus on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook to promote quick delivery and special offers. Zepto also uses precision messaging or micro-moments to engage customers when they are likely to make a purchase. Through online campaigns, Zepto builds brand awareness and encourages customers to use their service for fast grocery deliveries.\\\\nReferral Programs\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s referral program plays a crucial role in its successful marketing strategy. The program offers unique codes to its users for sharing, which incentivizes both existing and new users with rewards such as discounts. This helps in cost-effective customer acquisition and increases customer retention. The program\\\\\\'s seamless integration with social media, multiple reward options, and gamification elements make it a dynamic and impactful tool for Zepto\\\\\\'s growth and customer loyalty.\\\\nBeyond transactional benefits, Zepto\\\\\\'s referral initiative is a brand-building powerhouse, fostering advocacy and community engagement. By creating a positive customer experience and utilizing word-of-mouth influence, the program stands as a testament to the brand\\\\\\'s commitment to customer satisfaction and strategic marketing prowess.\\\\nPartnerships with Influencers\\\\nZepto partners with social media influencers who create authentic content to showcase its services. This helps Zepto build trust, connect with specific audiences, and reach more customers. This approach has fueled rapid growth, with the company raising over $300 million in just one year, emphasizing its focus on long-term customer relationships.\\\\nMarketing Campaign of Zepto\\\\nboAt, India’s leading audio brand, has teamed up with Zepto to bring high-quality audio products to your doorstep in just 10 minutes.

Outdoor advertising will be prominently displayed across major cities where Zepto operates, ensuring widespread visibility and engagement.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s \\\\\\'Nahi Milega\\\\\\' brand campaign underscores its commitment, emphasizing that while life may present unattainable challenges, unlimited free deliveries on Zepto are certain.\\\\nZepto adopted an unconventional approach by introducing Uncle Ji, a character from Delhi, several weeks before unveiling their brand campaign. The intention was to disrupt social media with Uncle Ji\\\\\\'s distinctive personality, straightforward expressions of reality, and the recurring catchphrase \\\\\\'Nahi Milega\\\\\\' (won\\\\\\'t be available).\\\\nZepto said Uncle Ji\\\\\\'s character achieved remarkable organic traction, accumulating 10 million impressions with a substantial 10% engagement rate across all social media platforms. Uncle Ji trended at #6 on Twitter and received endorsements from popular Twitter celebrities and Instagram meme pages, solidifying his status as a cultural icon in India.\\\\nZepto USP\\\\nZepto’s business model focuses on customers and offers instant delivery, setting it apart from competitors.

The shops sell a variety of products, and the sole way for buyers to place orders is through the Zepto India website or app. Across multiple regions, Zepto now has more than eighty-six dark storefronts. Dark businesses are great for quick shipping, but they may crash under heavy traffic. However, Zepto created an AI-driven system to assist with selecting, packing, and shipping to avoid sacrificing quality or service.

Founded in 2020 by Kaivalya Vohra and Aadit Palicha, both Stanford University dropouts, Zepto has grown from an ambitious startup to one of the fastest-growing players in the Indian grocery delivery market. This is a closer look at Zepto\\\\\\'s remarkable journey, key milestones, and its vision for the future.\\\\nThe Genesis of Zepto\\\\nThe inspiration for Zepto emerged from a clear gap in the Indian grocery delivery market. Kaivalya and Aadit, who were classmates at Stanford, saw a significant inefficiency in how grocery deliveries were being handled. Traditional models of online grocery shopping were often bogged down by long wait times and supply chain delays, further exacerbated by traffic and logistical hurdles in urban areas. The duo envisioned a service that could promise lightning-fast deliveries, with an average delivery time ranging from just 10 to 30 minutes. This was a bold move, considering the scale and complexity of grocery logistics.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s business model was built around a hyperlocal approach, relying on strategically placed \"dark stores\" (mini warehouses) within cities. These stores were stocked with a carefully curated range of everyday essentials, enabling efficient deliveries to customers in close proximity. The target market was clear: urban, tech-savvy consumers who craved convenience and the flexibility to get fresh groceries at their doorstep in record time.\\\\nEarly Struggles and Strategic Development\\\\nLike most successful startups, Zepto\\\\\\'s journey wasn\\\\\\'t without challenges. The founders initially faced numerous obstacles in building the platform, especially in ensuring fast, reliable, and scalable delivery logistics. Unlike traditional e-commerce, where products can be stored in large warehouses and shipped globally, grocery deliveries had to be quick and localized to succeed. Zepto had to develop an innovative infrastructure and fine-tune its logistics from the ground up.\\\\nIn the early days, Zepto also faced stiff competition from established players such as BigBasket and Amazon Pantry and newer entrants like Swiggy Instamart. However, it was Zepto\\\\\\'s unique value proposition—its emphasis on speed and a personalized user experience—that allowed it to differentiate itself from the competition.\\\\nKey Breakthroughs\\\\nThe years 2021 and 2022 marked significant breakthroughs for Zepto. With an initial seed round in hand, the startup raised additional funding to scale rapidly. A crucial moment in the company\\\\\\'s rise came when Zepto raised $60 million in a Series A funding round in 2021, which was followed by even larger investment rounds in 2022. These funds fuelled Zepto\\\\\\'s expansion into major metropolitan cities, including Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, and Chennai.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s model continued to evolve as it grew. The founders focused on optimizing supply chains, refining delivery processes, and using data analytics to predict demand more accurately. Zepto also invested heavily in technology, developing AI-driven solutions to streamline inventory management, delivery routes, and customer experience. This level of operational efficiency helped the company achieve faster deliveries, lower operational costs, and ultimately, higher profitability.\\\\nFunding Success and Valuation Surge\\\\nBy 2022, Zepto\\\\\\'s relentless pursuit of excellence and rapid expansion had paid off. In just two years, the company was able to raise multiple rounds of funding, reaching a valuation of approximately $900 million. The company attracted top investors, including Y Combinator, Nexus Venture Partners, and others. This impressive valuation placed Zepto among India\\\\\\'s most promising startups, setting the stage for future growth and innovation.\\\\nConsidering the growing demand for quick and reliable grocery deliveries, Zepto\\\\\\'s rapid rise to unicorn status (a valuation of over $1 billion) seemed almost inevitable. The company\\\\\\'s speed, operational excellence, and customer-centric approach positioned it as a serious contender in the Indian e-commerce space.\\\\nAdapting to Market Trends and Evolving Consumer Preferences\\\\nOne of the key reasons behind Zepto\\\\\\'s success is its ability to adapt to changing market trends and consumer preferences. As more consumers sought convenience and digital solutions in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Zepto quickly recognized and met this demand. It embraced cutting-edge technologies like AI, machine learning, and automation to fine-tune its processes. This allowed Zepto to predict consumer behavior more accurately, optimize its delivery routes in real-time, and ensure that customers received their orders as quickly as possible.\\\\nAdditionally, the company\\\\\\'s strong commitment to offering diverse products—from fresh fruits and vegetables to household staples—meant that Zepto was not just another delivery service. It became a one-stop shop for busy city dwellers seeking to save time and avoid the hassle of traditional grocery shopping. Zepto\\\\\\'s partnerships with local suppliers ensured that products were fresh, affordable, and available when needed.\\\\nNavigating Competition and Strategic Partnerships (2023)\\\\nAs the market for hyperlocal deliveries grew more competitive, Zepto found itself facing formidable rivals such as Blinkit (formerly Grofers) and Swiggy Instamart. To maintain its competitive edge, Zepto doubled down on its strengths: speed, customer satisfaction, and strategic partnerships.\\\\nThe company continued to refine its supply chain, leveraging third-party logistics companies and forging new relationships with suppliers to secure exclusive product offerings. These partnerships helped Zepto maintain its promise of delivering groceries in minutes, even as its competitors worked to catch up.\\\\nZepto also invested in marketing and brand-building campaigns, establishing itself as a household name in India\\\\\\'s urban centers. The company\\\\\\'s aggressive expansion strategies allowed it to further strengthen its market position, tapping into Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, where demand for quick commerce was rising.\\\\nLooking Ahead: International Expansion and Future Growth\\\\nWhile Zepto remains intensely focused on consolidating its position in India, the company is laying the groundwork for future international expansion. Drawing inspiration from its success in India\\\\\\'s urban markets, Zepto aims to replicate its rapid-delivery model in other regions, including Southeast Asia and the Middle East, where similar consumer trends for convenience-driven e-commerce are emerging.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s future growth strategy also involves deepening its focus on sustainability and technology innovation. The company plans to explore electric vehicle fleets for deliveries, reduce its carbon footprint, and expand its tech capabilities to create a seamless, data-driven delivery experience. As the demand for instant gratification continues to grow, Zepto\\\\\\'s model is well-positioned to evolve and capture new opportunities.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nFrom its inception in 2020 to its remarkable growth in just a few short years, Zepto\\\\\\'s success story is one of vision, perseverance, and innovation. The company\\\\\\'s ability to combine speed, technology, and customer-centricity has transformed the Indian grocery delivery landscape. With its eyes set on international markets and continued technological innovation, Zepto is poised to become a global leader in the rapid-commerce space.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s journey is a testament to the power of understanding market needs, leveraging cutting-edge technology, and executing with precision.

The main drivers of the expansion of online grocery in these markets have been shifting consumer behaviour and customers are becoming more acclimated to online purchasing. As a result, the market for grocery delivery is considered to be quite hopeful.\\\\nSimilar to this, the Indian grocery delivery business, which had a valuation of USD 2.9 billion in 2020, is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 37.1 per cent from 2021 to 2028.

But how does the incredibly quick delivery work? Unlike other grocery delivery services, which often take 30 minutes. The heart of Zepto is included in this blog. Continue reading to the end to learn more.\\\\nAbout Zepto\\\\nA startup in Mumbai named Zepto provides a 10-minute grocery delivery service. Zepto is a startup founded by Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra that specialises in quick grocery delivery business.\\\\nZepto is praised for being an expert at delivering food before the new year. In 2021, it produced more than one million deliveries while collaborating with 86+ owners of dark stores in thirteen different locations. Zepto uses its network of “cloud shops” or “micro-warehouses” to fill orders quickly.\\\\nZepto’s key to success is its ability to regularly manufacture over 2,500 items for delivery in less than ten minutes. Everything the company does is centred around that, which is how they’ve been able to expand so swiftly while keeping amazing client loyalty.\\\\nThe Parel-based speedy grocery delivery business has reduced the time it takes to deliver groceries to only 10 minutes, thanks to the dark store concept. Rapid commerce is reportedly the next big opportunity the grocery delivery industry wants to seize. Among the fastest-growing businesses in the faster-delivery industry are startups like Zepto in India and Fridge No More in New York City.\\\\nZepto – Industry\\\\nZepto: Industry The $1 trillion retail industry in India, where groceries account for the great majority of consumer expenditure, is helping e-grocery delivery gain pace. The Indian e-grocery market was estimated to be worth $2.9 billion in 2020, and from 2021 to 2028, it is anticipated to increase at a rate of 37.1 per cent.\\\\nDue to changing consumer preferences, increasing urbanisation, and a tech-savvy population that prefers to make purchases online, the industry has seen an increase in prominence over the past few months.\\\\nAccording to a RedSeer report, the fast commerce market will be worth $30 million by 2021. The same market was expected to rise by 15X to $5 billion in 2025.\\\\nConsumers increasingly use specialised and practical internet platforms for food shopping instead of going to their neighbourhood stores as their standard of living rises, and their daily schedules become busier.\\\\nThe appeal of internet grocery delivery business was more apparent after the COVID-19 outbreak. Due to social distance restrictions, consumers are switching to online food shopping because it is not only practical but also secure.\\\\nZepto – Founders and Team\\\\nAadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra, two childhood friends who are both 19 years old, founded Zepto after leaving Stanford University’s esteemed computer science department to go back to their native India and launch a business. The business started operating in April of this year after being created in September of the previous year.\\\\nAadit Palicha\\\\nThe CEO and Co-Founder of both Zepto and KiranaKart is Aadit Palicha. Palicha completed a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science at Stanford University after earning an IB diploma in Mathematics and Computer Science from GEMS Education. Following the completion of Y Combinator Grade: W21, Aadit began working as a Project Lead for PryvaSee. Then, at the age of 17, Aadit Palicha launched GoPool, his first firm. In April 2020, he quit the company and started KiranaKart and Zepto.\\\\nKaivalya Vohra\\\\nKaivalya Vohra is a co-founder and chief technology officer of both Zepto and KiranaKart. He attended Y Combinator with Aadit and has a computer science degree from Stanford University.\\\\nThe number of employees at Zepto ranges from 51 to 200.\\\\nZepto – Startup Story\\\\nEven those of us who are the most creative struggle to see through our “startup ideas,” which are many. Palicha and Vohra had both enrolled at Stanford to pursue degrees in computer science but had left to pursue their interests in entrepreneurship.\\\\nZepto was born out of the constraints of their homes during the Covid-19 outbreak. Groceries and other necessities would arrive in a few days due to increased demand for delivery services, leaving a gap for speedy delivery. Zepto was then developed using all of this knowledge.\\\\nThese youngsters worked together on numerous initiatives, including a ride-hailing app for children, before being abruptly imprisoned in their Mumbai homes due to Covid restrictions. As the virus spread across the country, grocery delivery business—which local authorities still considered to be important—was still allowed in many areas. Still, the two struggled to receive their supplies as the epidemic grew.\\\\nZepto is getting all the limelight, but Palicha and Vohra’s initial business, KiranaKart, did not get the same attention. On the other hand, Zepto draws inspiration from KiranaKart. KiranaKart was a grocery delivery business, as its name suggests. With Kirana traders, it has made arrangements to deliver groceries in 45 minutes or less. Global Founders Capital, 2 AM Ventures, Contrary Capital, and angel investors led a $730,000 pre-seed investment. At the time, Vohra and Palicha intended to charge Rs 1 for the initial 1.5 lakh delivery.\\\\nZepto Business Model: Dark Store model\\\\nDark storefronts may appear ominous, but they undercut one of the many clever strategies that have kept some retail establishments afloat during the pandemic. Dark stores are distribution centres that aren’t accessible to the public. These small warehouses efficiently and precisely fill orders, giving customers access to resources and choices, including online shopping, same-day delivery, and in-store pickup.\\\\nThe founders said that the dark store model’s brilliance is how quickly they pick, pack, and ship merchandise. The last mile is similar to every other delivery strategy, though.\\\\nA similar methodology has been used in Western countries, but it has never been investigated in the Indian setting. The “dark store model” eliminates the minor issues that any delivery service experiences, such as traffic jams, connectivity, and navigation. According to Zepto, the network’s performance has improved due to the use of location intelligence, geography, population, road patterns, traffic dynamics, weather, last-mile supply availability, real estate values, and other factors. Additionally, it currently operates over 40 dark stores across several locales.\\\\nDark stores, however, can’t handle high sales volumes because they’re designed for rapid deliveries. Zepto, however, refused to make allowances for this model’s flaws. They have nearly a thousand items on display, including the finest deals on fresh vegetables, milk, meat, and kitchen supplies. Additionally, their AI-powered technologies guarantee a seamless changeover between selecting, packing, and shipping.\\\\nBenefits of Zepto Business Model\\\\n-\\\\nImproved Distribution and faster delivery\\\\nZepto can fulfil orders more swiftly and effectively thanks to the dark store. Micro and cold warehouses offer various distribution options, which also physically deliver groceries closer to a particular market group. Zepto can better regulate the distribution and market spread thanks to this.\\\\n-\\\\nBroader Customer Reach\\\\nThe dark stores make distribution hubs more accessible to customers, and they accept orders 24/7 online. Customers are drawn to these platforms and employ their services as a result.\\\\n-\\\\nContactless Shopping\\\\nThe need for contact-free shopping has primarily influenced businesses’ adoption of the “dark store” strategy. Dark stores enable customers to buy food without interacting with other people or going into a physical store. They put things online and have them delivered right away.\\\\n-\\\\nImproved Inventory Control and Better Product Assortment\\\\nDark stores have no customers, greater inventory control, and can handle higher order quantities. Packers can move as swiftly as possible to pack the things in an order thanks to the dark stores’ convenient navigation. Additionally, Zepto’s AI-powered solutions maintain product assortment and inventory stock tracking.\\\\nZepto’s USPs\\\\nZepto’s business strategy is absolutely focused on providing quick service to customers. Zepto, however, also offers several selling factors that distinguish it from its rivals. Nevertheless, the model also takes these into account.\\\\nZepto is known for its rapid commerce and instant delivery. It claims to have a median delivery time of 8 minutes, 47 seconds and completes grocery deliveries in under 10 minutes.\\\\nAccording to the founders, by the time a user verifies his order, it has already been dispatched for delivery. Additionally, practically all orders are completed in less than 10 minutes, although 1% of them may require 15–16 minutes or even longer.\\\\nZepto offers free shipping. Although this USP pales compared to the first, there are no delivery fees. At the same time, other companies like Instacart, Amazon Fresh, and others charge a delivery fee.\\\\nFree service does not imply more expensive goods. It offers some attractive discounts on the mentioned goods and foods, which is still another USP.\\\\nZepto – Future Plans\\\\nThe Mumbai-based company will use the money to expand its clientele, hire more staff, and open more dark stores in new cities. Bengaluru and the Delhi-National Capital Region have it already, and Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, and Kolkata will get it within the next 30 days.\\\\nIt plans to open 100 dark enterprises by the end of the year, covering about 100 pin codes. By the end of this year, quick commerce is expected to reach $300 million, and by the year 2025, it will grow to $5 billion.\\\\nNo one in India has fully grasped marketing, according to co-founder Palicha. He continued by saying that when you look at a few older organisations who are trying to follow this strategy, you’ll discover that many of them lack the consistency to run on a single model and are unfocused. They engage in various activities, which is the biggest problem in every major company.\\\\n“We have seen our median delivery times stabilise if not decrease, mainly because as we scale our coverage and our expansion, it ends up being a factor of individual cloud stores and how they perform,” he said.\\\\nExpress delivery is not a fresh idea; the majority of current e-grocers have tried it in the past, with varying degrees of success. These platforms have been bringing back quick delivery to customers, especially via the dark-store concept, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic’s quicker acceptance of online groceries.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nZepto has secured $100 million in Series C funding, valued at $570 million, led by Y Combinator’s Continuity Fund. The founders say that investments in Zepto will help it reach more customers and provide them with better service. As of now, Zepto operates in the Indian metros. However, it has not revealed its consumer count, but sources say Zepto is growing at 200% every month.\\\\nAs we mentioned earlier, the 10 min grocery delivery service has disrupted the grocery delivery space. When it became clear that it couldn’t deliver groceries in under 10 minutes, Blinkit (December 2021) announced a temporary suspension of its operation in those locations. While the market leader Swiggy announced a $700 million investment in its grocery delivery business, Swiggy Instamart, and plans to complete deliveries in 15 minutes by January 2022. By the end of Q2 in FY22, Fraazo, a grocery delivery business with headquarters in Mumbai, plans to triple the number of its dark stores to 750. Dunzo and BigBasket are vying to enter the quick-commerce market.\\\\nReturning to Zepto, it takes a mix of a laser-like focus, swift action, and a resilient team. Additionally, it entered the supermarket delivery area at an excellent time.\\\\n                \\\\n                - What is Zepto?\\\\n- Zepto Business Model: Dark Store model\\\\n- Benefits of the Zepto Business Model\\\\n- Zepto\\\\\\'s USPs\\\\n- Conclusion\\\\n- Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\\\\nTable of Contents\\\\nZepto Business Model- How Zepto works and makes money?\\\\nGrocery delivery is a booming sector in terms of focus, participation, and investment.

They played with a couple of models before morphing it into Zepto. And after its inception, it has been in the headlines.\\\\nTheir idea was simple: build the fastest grocery delivery service ecosystem in the subcontinent. However, the proposition is difficult to achieve accounting for traffic congestion, roads, and discount-seeking Indian consumers.\\\\nSo, they had to do enough brainstorming to plan the execution of their business, which now seems to pay off.\\\\nIn an interview with YS, Aadit says, \"I think a lot of the competition in the space is either in executing grocery delivery or is focused on multiple different models, which is where we saw the opportunity.\"\\\\nToday, Zepto operates in 20+ Indian cities (including Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru, and Chennai) and is valued at $1.4 billion.\\\\nZepto Business Model: Dark Store model\\\\nDark stores may seem sinister, but it undermines one of the many bright ideas that have helped several retail businesses stay afloat during the pandemic.\\\\nDark stores are distribution outlets that are not open to visitors.\\\\nThese micro warehouses quickly and accurately fulfill orders and thus provide shoppers with resources and options like purchasing products online, same-day delivery, or pickup in-store.\\\\nThe founders said that the magic of the dark store model is how they pick, pack and dispatch goods in under 60 seconds.

Both these teenagers had partnered on several other projects earlier. They created a ride-hailing commute app suitable for school-going kids. But this time they found themselves locked in their homes when they arrived in Mumbai.\\\\nWith the pandemic raging on mercilessly, both the teenagers were struggling to get their grocery supplies. This was even though grocery deliveries were categorized as essential by the government. They felt the need for having an online player for the grocery delivery sector in India. Despite being one of the largest markets in the world they were still grappling with some execution errors.\\\\nAlso Read\\\\n“I was told service class people cannot afford to start a business”\\\\nHow Zepto works\\\\nZepto has places called dark stores or micro fulfillment centers that lie in higher-demand neighborhoods. These dark stores use technology for performing tasks such as the placement of products. Some other tasks they perform include deciding the store locations, and mapping delivery routes for avoiding heavy traffic congestions. The company is already delivering items that include cooking necessities, fresh produce, personal care items, snacks and beverages, and home cleaning items.\\\\nAlso Read\\\\n“Best-selling on Zomato, still I want my own online platform”\\\\nAcquiring talent\\\\nOne of the main things that went in the right direction for the startup was the talent acquisition department. They were able to attract several top-profile executives from Amazon Uber, Pharmeasy, Flipkart, and Dream 11 to join their organization.\\\\nThe main thing that led to so many top executives deciding to join Zepto was that it allowed several people that moved to Bangalore to come back to Mumbai. However, the aggressive growth of the startup, its ambition, and its disciplined execution have led to several people that are similarly inclined to be attracted to the company.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nSeveral other players are trying to participate in the market and trying to grow quickly. But they cannot promise things such as 10-minute delivery as consistently as Zepto. This period extends to 30, 40, and 45 minutes in most cases. Zepto is a detail-oriented and intense business with strong technical and operating discipline that allows them to pull off the 10-minute delivery.\\\\nBuild your own app like Zepto\\\\nIf you are looking to set up an on-demand business one of the best places to visit for a technology-based solution will be Jungleworks.

Just like window shopping, you can select and buy groceries that will be delivered to you. However, most of the delivery services take almost thirty minutes to deliver the product but there is a company that delivers the groceries within 10 minutes after placing the order. That company is none other than “Zepto.”\\\\nHave you ever wondered how Zepto delivers the order so quickly and how it gained its reputation within three years of establishment? The reason behind this success is their impactful and smart business technique. This article provides an explanation of the “Zepto Business Model.”\\\\nThe business model of Zepto consists of three essential components-\\\\n- Working Strategy\\\\n- Marketing Strategy\\\\n- Revenue Sources\\\\nWorking Strategy\\\\nThe main objective of Zepto is to provide the best and quickest service to its customers. The efficient working strategy of Zepto is based on four pillars, namely-\\\\n1: Q- Commerce\\\\nIt stands for quick commerce. It is an instant service model of e-commerce where the marketing and dealings (buying & selling) of products & services occur on the internet. Zepto efficiently utilizes the internet to execute its business. The customers place their orders on the Zepto app and their products are delivered quickly with the help of dark store models or micro markets. It delivers various types of items like fresh produce, snacks, beverages, dry rations, cleaning items, personal care items, etc.\\\\n2: Dark Store Model\\\\nThis is the core working strategy of Zepto. The dark stores are Micro Warehouses (the physical outlets) specially installed for the distribution of the products. These are not open to visitors i.e., you cannot buy the products directly (offline) from the distribution outlets of Zepto. The dark store uses advanced AI-powered technology to perform various tasks ranging from placement of orders, packaging the products, mapping the traffic-free routes for quick delivery routes, and buying fresh grocery items from the bulk distributors. You need to place the order on the Zepto app. Thereafter, their team fulfills the orders and delivers the product to your doorstep.\\\\n3: Key Partners\\\\nThere are three key partners of Zepto- Local Stores, Financial Partners, and Delivery Partners. Zepto buys the groceries in bulk from the local stores and transfers them into the dark stores (micro warehouses). The financial partners aid in the digital payment systems for Zepto. The delivery partners help in the delivery of products from dark stores to customers.\\\\n4: Usage of AI–Powered Technology\\\\nAI-powered technology is the key reason for the smooth working of Zepto. It utilizes location intelligence and geospatial data to determine the target population/audience, geographical location of the customers, patterns of roads, traffic dynamics (to select the roads having less traffic/crowd), supply availability (availability of the products that the customer ordered), weather conditions (for instance, heavy rainfall may disrupt the product delivery), values of the real estate (for establishing a dark store), etc.\\\\nIn short, the customers register and log in to the Zepto app and place an order. The dark store present in the nearest location of the customer receives the notification about the order of the customer. The team present in the dark store packs the item and hands it over to the delivery partner. The delivery man delivers the order to the location of the customer by using the quickest possible route. Finally, the customer receives the product and makes the payments.\\\\nMarketing Strategy\\\\nThe marketing strategy of Zepto mainly involves online Ad campaigns. The ad campaigns of Zepto are one of the best among its competitors. Their advertisements are quirky enough with the tagline of “10-minute delivery” and “zero delivery charges” to hit the target audience and encourage them to use Zepto app. The quick delivery of products within 10 minutes is the USP (Unique Selling Proposition) that helps it stand out among its competitors. Other than ad campaigns, Zepto uses the following marketing strategies-\\\\n- Social Media Marketing\\\\n- Influencer Marketing\\\\n- Television commercials\\\\nRevenue Sources\\\\nThe major revenue of Zepto lies in its “Commission Based Model” and funding rounds.\\\\n- Commissions– It receives a commission of 2-4% on each order placed through its app. These commissions help to cover the costs of the expenditures.\\\\n- Funding Rounds- It raised a significant amount of money through multiple funding rounds. As of today, the value of Zepto is around USD 900 million.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nThe impactful working and marketing strategy of Zepto has played a key role in the success of this quickest-growing startup. It works on a brilliant business model that contributes to the accomplishment of the tasks within the stipulated time. As a result, it gained broader customer reach and effectively boosts contactless shopping for customers.\\\\n                \\\\n                International Journal of Advanced Research in Commerce, Management &Social Science (IJARCMSS) 193 \\\\nISSN :2581-7930,  Impact Factor : 6.809, Volume 05, No. 04(II), October-December,  2022, pp 193-196 \\\\n  \\\\n \\\\nJUST IN 10 MINUTES: A CASE STUDY ON ZEPTO \\\\n \\\\n Dr. Sunita Gupta\\\\uf02a \\\\nAvani Pandey** \\\\nABSTRACT \\\\n \\\\nThis case discusses the working of Zepto , an e -commerce company founded in April 2021 in \\\\nBandra, Mumbai by two 19 -year-old Stanford dropouts Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra.  Well, they are \\\\nnot newbies in the start -up world, this is their third start -up after GoPool and Kiranakart.  They came with \\\\nthis ground-breaking idea while sitting in their homes and waiting for their groceries to be delivered in 2 -3 \\\\ndays. Zepto belongs to those start -up subgroups that experienced meteoric development in the post -\\\\nCovid period. This case explains the developme nt process of how the company is making it possible to \\\\ndeliver items in 10 minutes. Zepto has raised $360 million in funding with the lead investors being the \\\\nAmerican start up accelerator company Y Combinator and the American growth equity firm Glade Broo k \\\\nCapital Partners. Currently, the company has a valuation of $900 million. 1 So, the possibility that Zepto  \\\\nwill soon turn into a unicorn is not a daft idea. However, there is a major concern surrounding Zepto’ s \\\\nbusiness model as they have still not made the business profitable. Zepto is also facing tough \\\\ncompetition from its rival Blinkit (formerly known as Grofers) who was founded in December 2013. \\\\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\\\n \\\\nKeywords: Zepto, Start-up, E-commerce, Business Model, Post-Covid. \\\\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\\\n \\\\nIntroduction \\\\n Zepto is a quick e-commerce company that started its operations in 2021. \\\\n The company started its operations in Bandra, Mumbai and has subsequently extended its \\\\ndelivery areas to Pune, Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Ghaziabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata. \\\\n On October 31, 2021, a total of 8 investors, led by Glade Brook Capital Partners, invested in \\\\nthem $60 million after which more investors began to notice them. Later, they raised additional funding \\\\nthrough their series C and series D rounds. Y Combinator Continuity Fund became the major investor in \\\\nboth of these rounds. \\\\n The Series C and D rounds were held on December 20, 2021 and May 2, 2022 and raised $100 \\\\nmillion and $200 million respectively2.But Zepto is not the only quick commerce start-up that is backed by \\\\nstrong funding, it is up against fierce competition in India from Blinkit. Blinkit has received backing from \\\\n24 investor s and has gone through a total of 19 fundraising rounds. Blinkit is currently valued at $1 \\\\nbillion3. And then there is also Dunzo which is backed by Google. \\\\nZepto’ s tagline is \"Groceries delivered in 10 minutes”. They do this with the help of Dark stores . \\\\nThey are nothing but warehouses that are not open to the public and are located in such area in the \\\\nneighbourhood where demand is high.Only commonly requested commodities are kept in these \\\\nwarehouses, preventing the loss of unsold stock. Zepto’ s dark st ores are designed in a way so that \\\\norders are filled as rapidly as possible, effectively and efficiently reducing time. Currently, Zepto is \\\\ndelivering 2500+ goods, including food and drink, personal care products, fresh produce, home cleaning \\\\nsupplies, and  snacks and beverages, from its 100+ dark stores. As stated by the CEO of zepto  Aadit \\\\nPalicha the average delivery time taken by Zepto is 8 minutes and 47 seconds. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf02a Supervisor, Mentor &Associate Professor, Department of Commerce, Daulat Ram College, University of \\\\nDelhi, Delhi, India. \\\\n**  Student pursuing B.

The company uses artificial intelligence (AI) t o \\\\nenhance the effectiveness of its delivery network by taking into account variables like weather, traffic \\\\npatterns, population, geography, and the availability of last-mile supplies. \\\\n The co-founders have managed to make the roots of the company strong by  getting the best \\\\ntalent out there to work for them when they first started building a team.  They were successful in \\\\npersuading a number of high-profile executives from Dream 11, Amazon, Uber, Pharmeasy, and Flipkart. \\\\n(Source: LinkedIn) \\\\nThese qualified exe cutives have assisted Zepto in achieving unit economics and capital \\\\nefficiency. They are what have allowed Zepto to carve out a place for itself in the grocery’s delivery \\\\nmarket. \\\\nFindings  \\\\nGroceries account for the majority of India\\\\\\'s $1 trillion retail market.1 Consequently, this market \\\\nhas enormous potential. During Corona, it was challenging to leave the house every time you wanted to \\\\nbuy a small essential item, and today with people having to work for long hours, especially in urban cities, \\\\nit is challenging to go out and shop for daily groceries. The market needed an app like Zepto more than it \\\\nwanted one, thus its release was ideal. These apps help customers to save their time  and make their life \\\\neasier. As of right now, as mentioned by the C EO of zepto, they receive 100,000 orders each day, and \\\\ntheir demand curve is essentially flat. They once more turn to technology to determine the ideal location \\\\nfor their tiny fulfilment centres. \\\\nAlthough some would believe that Zepto’ s delivery speed is what sets them apart from the \\\\ncompetition, this is not the case. The key element that sets zepto apart from its rivals is not the quickness \\\\nof the delivery men, but rather how effectively it uses technology. Zepto tracks its customers\\\\\\' spatial data, \\\\ntraffic dynamics, the time it takes to deliver the items, etc. with the aid of www.locus.sh. They collect this \\\\ndata and analyse it to decide whether they need more dark stores in the area to be able to achieve that \\\\n10-minute goal. \\\\nZepto Generates Income in Two Ways \\\\n• It first negotiates a profit margin with the companies based on how much of their product is kept \\\\nin the warehouse. \\\\n• Second, they make money by charging companies for ad space and the top search results. \\\\n• Zepto had total revenue of INR 142.3 Cr in FY22, while incurring costs of INR 532.7 Cr. They \\\\nsuffered a loss of 390.3 Cr INR as a result. \\\\nMarketing costs make up the majority of their spending \\\\nThey invest a lot of money in promoting and advertising their app. During FY22, they spent INR \\\\n175.5 Cr, or almo st 33% of their overall expenses on marketing. In addition to this, the firm spent INR \\\\n213.2 Cr on stock -in-trade purchases in FY22. Employee benefits cost INR 50.3 Cr, while supply chain \\\\ncosts were INR 74 Cr.2 \\\\nZepto’ s EBITDA margin in FY22 was -259.39%.3An EBITDA offers a clear picture of the \\\\ncompany\\\\\\'s worth and displays it to potential buyers and investors. Unfortunately, Zepto’ s EBITDA is \\\\nnegative. \\\\n To distribute the products, Zepto utilizes gig workers. These individuals make an average \\\\nincome of INR 1,30,211.4 \\\\n Zepto has been able to outperform the competition because of its business model. They have a \\\\nhighly effective distribution system, and Zepto’ s AI-powered tools make it simple to manage and keep an \\\\neye on inventory and product selection. This leads to better in ventory management and a wider range of \\\\nproducts. Additionally, they have a large consumer base that is constantly growing. \\\\n \\\\n1  https://www.statista.com/statistics/1021352/india-organized-retail-market-value/https://www.statista.com/topics/5615/food-retail-in \\\\nindia/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20the%20food%20and%20grocery,retail%20market%20at%2063%20percent . \\\\n2  https://www.vccircle.com/zeptounlikely-to-turn-profitable-in-near-term \\\\n3  https://inc42.com/buzz/zepto-incurs-inr-390-cr-loss-in-first-year-of-operations-fy22-sales-at-inr-\\\\n141r/#:~:text=Zepto%2C%20which%20began%20operations%20in,stood%20at%20INR%20140.7%20Cr . \\\\n4  https://www.ambitionbox.com/salaries/zepto-salaries/delivery-boy \\\\x0cDr. Sunita Gupta & Avani Pandey: Just in 10 Minutes: A Case Study on Zepto 195 \\\\nDiscussion \\\\n Zepto is indeed facing losses but it is only natural for a fledgling enterprise in their early years of \\\\noperations to incur some loss.  While Zepto has suffered losses, it is still in a better situation than Blinkit \\\\nand Dunzo, which have suffered losses of INR 1,019 Cr and INR 464 Cr respectively.1 \\\\nThe quick commerce industry has a customer base that is not very devoted, s o even if delivery \\\\ntime increases by a few minutes, customers will still go where they can obtain the best deals. \\\\n Zepto has to strike a balance between discounts and deals and keep their delivery time between \\\\n10 and 20 minutes. Blinkit is their sole main rival at the moment in this market. They need to start \\\\npenetrating into newer cities if they want to distinctly emerge as the leaders of quick commerce. \\\\nZepto has to diversify its revenue streams and stop relying solely on a limited range of sources. \\\\nAccording to the founders of Zepto, they are planning to open a Zepto café that will provide popular \\\\nbrand’s coffee and tea. If it were to become a reality, it may  be successful since metropolitan city\\\\\\'s youth \\\\nrun on caffeine, and hitting up chaayos or blue tokaievery time you feel like drinking one is impractical. If \\\\nZepto wants to make this business a success, they will need more funding. Since Zepto has already \\\\nestablished a reputation for itself and everything associated with that name would benefit from its \\\\ngoodwill, their marketing costs shouldn\\\\\\'t be too high. \\\\nZepto, as well as any other rapid commerce start -up, solely receives criticism for how it treats \\\\ndelivery guys. Due to the shorter time constraints these workers must adhere to, they may drive rashly, \\\\nincreasing the chances of accidents.  Zepto, however, refutes these criticisms by pointing to their \\\\nadvanced technology, which enables the driver to arrive at the destination both securely and on time. \\\\nSWOT Analysis \\\\nStrengths \\\\n• Excellent usage of technology:  With the assistance of www.locus.sh Zepto records its \\\\ncustomers\\\\\\' geographical data, traffic dynamics, delivery time, and so on. They gather and \\\\nevaluate this data to determine whether more dark establishments are needed in the region to \\\\nmeet the 10-minute objective. \\\\n• Being true to their objective:  Zepto ensures that their customers\\\\\\' expectations are met by \\\\ndelivering goods in 10 minutes. Zepto achieves their ai m 90% of the time, which contributes to \\\\nbrand loyalty. \\\\n• Strong financial support:  Zepto is well -funded, which allows it to expand and grow into a \\\\nmarket leader. They currently have a total funding of $360 million. \\\\n• Competent Workforce: The effective management of Zepto is in the hands of highly skilled and \\\\nexperienced professionals. They are Zepto’ s most valuable resource since they are well -\\\\ninformed about the market. Palicha and Vohra, the co -founders, did a fantastic job in creating \\\\ntheir team. \\\\nWeakness \\\\n• Reliance on retailers: Zepto’s business strategy is primarily dependent on other businesses \\\\nand their inventory. When a retailer\\\\\\'s stock is unavailable, customers may be forced to select a \\\\nhigher-priced substitution or go without buying that item from them. \\\\n• Fluctuating customer base:  To keep their clientele, Zepto must find a balance between their \\\\ndiscount strategy and keeping their delivery time under 10 minutes. \\\\n• Net Income: Zepto’s operational costs are high. They need to grow their sales while decreasing  \\\\nsome of their expenditures to make their business profitable. \\\\n• Nothing Unique: Zepto’s business strategy is not very unique, and any company may enter this \\\\nmarket and replicate it. \\\\n \\\\n1  https://www.vccircle.com/blinkits-marketplace-arm-s-fy22-loss-widens-to-over-rs-1-000-\\\\ncrore#:~:text=Blinkit\\\\\\'s%20marketplace%20arm\\\\\\'s%20FY22%20loss%20widens%20to%20over%20Rs%201%2C000%20crore, -\\\\nBy%20Malvika%20Maloo&text=Zomato%2Downed%20Blinkit\\\\\\'s%20marketplace%20arm,on%20transportation%2C%20contract%\\\\n20and%20advertising. \\\\nhttps://inc42.com/buzz/dunzos-loss-widens-2x-to-inr-464-cr-in-fy22-as-expenses-also-double/#:~:text=Share%20story-\\\\n,Dunzo\\\\\\'s%20Loss%20Widens%202X%20To%20INR%20464,FY22%20As%20E xpenses%20Also%20Double&text=Bengaluru%2\\\\nDbased%20hyperlocal%20delivery%20platform,due%20to%20doubling%20of%20expenses . \\\\n \\\\x0c196 International Journal of Advanced Research in Commerce, Management & Social Science (IJARCMSS)  -October-December, 2022 \\\\nOpportunity \\\\n• Infiltrating further into existing locations and entering fresh  cities: One way they can \\\\noutperform their competitors is to grow their business as quickly as possible. \\\\n• Various Business Ventures:  Zepto has developed a brand identity for itself, which they can \\\\nnow utilize to enter into other sectors and diversify their revenue stream. \\\\nThreats \\\\nHeavy competition: Zepto is in a league with big names. Customers swing from one app to the \\\\nnext like a pendulum. Because there is little consumer loyalty, Zepto must continually stay on top of their \\\\ngame. \\\\n Exploitation of delivery boys: There are several sceptics of the quick commerce industry. \\\\nDelivery boys are exploited in the name of quick delivery and are subjected to extreme strain, increasing \\\\nthe likelihood of an accident. \\\\nConclusion  \\\\nSince its start in April 2021, Zepto has grown organically to become one of India\\\\\\'s most valuable \\\\nand promising start -ups. Zepto has everything a successful firm requires: a talented and dedicated \\\\nworkforce, solid funding, and the use of technology to operate rapidly. However, they cannot handle huge \\\\nsales volume since the dark stores they utilise for speedy delivery are not built to support large scale \\\\noperations. They  keep a limited number of fresh items in hand because if they are not sold, they will \\\\nsuffer losses as the items stale. As a result , there is a possibility that the consumer use competitor\\\\\\'s app \\\\nsince the things they want are out of stock. \\\\nOn the face of it, if Blinkit exists& grows, it is difficult for Zepto  to be the market leader. Both \\\\nhave a nearly identical business model, and Bl inkit’ s delivery time is also less than 10 minutes so \\\\nactually they both don’t have anything unique that sets them apart. The only thing that can help Zepto to \\\\ncompete with Blinkit and become a stable business firm is expanding into more cities and having  a wider \\\\nrange of products to pick from. \\\\nZepto along with other apps is effectively breaking the mould of traditional purchasing and \\\\nestablishing an e-consumerism habit. There is no doubt that Zepto is now expanding faster than anybody \\\\nelse in this sector. They are detail-oriented and employ AI-based technologies well. \\\\nZepto is expected to become a unicorn in 2023. 1However, being a unicorn does not imply that \\\\nthe firm is profitable. \\\\nIn the FY22 their revenue was considerable, as seen by the number of orders they received \\\\neach day, but their operational costs were high and  hence they suffered losses. If they want to become a \\\\nprofitable firm, they must expand into newer cities while adhering to their basic principles and finding \\\\nmethods to reduce their operational expenses. \\\\nReferences  \\\\n1. https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto/news \\\\n2. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto \\\\n3. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zepto-29b1 \\\\n4. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/grofers-trusted-delivery-partner \\\\n5.

Hence, these stores can generate their own cash.\"\\\\nSince its last funding round in October, Zepto\\\\\\'s business has expanded by over 100%, and its EBITDA has improved by 6%.\\\\nZepto now plans to broaden its product range to include categories such as fashion, jewelry, toys, beauty, and electronics.\\\\n                \\\\n                One of the top rapid commerce companies in India, Zepto, is making waves once more as it moves into advanced talks to finance $100–150 million from Motilal Oswal and many Indian family offices and high-net-worth individuals (HNIs). Following many significant investments over the previous several months, the company has raised additional capital to further establish itself as a major player in the fiercely competitive fast delivery market.\\\\nCredits: The Hindu Business Line\\\\nMotilal Oswal Leading the Charge\\\\nMotilal Oswal, a prominent financial services firm, is expected to invest $40 million into Zepto. Of this, Raamdeo Agrawal, the chairman and co-founder of Motilal Oswal, is set to personally contribute $15 million, according to those close to the matter. Agrawal is already an existing investor in Zepto and is now looking to further increase his stake in the rapidly growing company.\\\\nThe discussions have reportedly been ongoing for the last three months, and the deal is expected to close soon. In addition to Motilal Oswal’s direct investment, the firm is also helping facilitate another $60-110 million from various Indian family offices and HNIs. If successful, the round would inject significant capital into Zepto at a time when the quick commerce sector is fiercely contested by established giants.\\\\nCredits: Money Control\\\\nA Cash Chest to Compete with Industry Majors\\\\nZepto’s ability to raise such large sums of capital in a short span underscores the growing investor confidence in the quick commerce model. As traditional retailers like DMart begin to feel the pressure from rapid delivery services, Zepto is preparing to compete head-to-head with well-established names in the space.\\\\nThis funding would be Zepto’s third major round in less than four months, signaling its aggressive growth strategy as it races toward an IPO. The additional funds would allow Zepto to expand its operations, improve its infrastructure, and keep pace with competitors like Zomato’s Blinkit, IPO-bound Swiggy, Flipkart Minutes, and Tata’s BigBasket, all of whom are vying for dominance in the 10-20 minute delivery space.\\\\nThe Race for Market Dominance\\\\nZepto would benefit greatly from its most recent capital infusion, which would allow it to scale more quickly and firmly establish its market position as the competition in the quick commerce space heats up. By providing customers with the ease of almost instantaneous delivery, rapid delivery startups are upending traditional grocery retail. This approach has proven particularly popular in densely populated urban regions.\\\\nThe market is far from simple, though. Competing businesses are also stepping up their initiatives. Zomato’s Blinkit has the support of a publicly traded firm, while Swiggy’s Instamart is gearing up for an initial public offering. The market is now more competitive than ever because to the aggressive expansion of BigBasket’s rapid delivery division, Flipkart Minutes, and the latter’s quick commerce service.\\\\nFor Zepto, maintaining its $5 billion valuation while raising fresh capital demonstrates its ability to attract high-level investors and its growth potential. The influx of funds will also enable Zepto to invest in technology, improve logistics, and expand its delivery network across more cities in India.\\\\nZepto’s Meteoric Rise\\\\nZepto’s fundraising success is nothing short of impressive. The company, which was founded just three years ago, has rapidly ascended in the crowded quick commerce market. It first made waves in June 2024 when it raised $665 million at a valuation of $3.6 billion. Barely two months later, it secured an additional $340 million, pushing its valuation to $5 billion.\\\\nZepto has raised $1.6 billion in total so far, more than $1 billion of which has been raised in the last four months alone. This amount of money shows that investors believe Zepto’s business strategy, which depends on providing clients with necessities in a matter of minutes, has long-term promise.\\\\nCompanies such as Zepto are placing their bets on the notion that convenience and speed will turn into the distinguishing characteristics of future retail experiences, as the rapid commerce industry continues to develop. Zepto intends to address the rising demand for prompt, dependable delivery by expanding its network of dark stores—small warehouses designed for quick order fulfillment—and acquiring a cutting-edge logistics infrastructure.\\\\n                \\\\n                Why Zepto is planning $250M secondary sale prior to IPO\\\\nWhat\\\\\\'s the story\\\\nZepto, a leading player in the quick commerce space, is said to be in talks for a secondary sale of up to $250 million.\\\\nThe deal involves its existing shareholders and seeks to boost the stake of Indian investors ahead of the company\\\\\\'s anticipated initial public offering (IPO) later this year or early 2026.\\\\nThe talks revolve around investment arms of Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd., and Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd. buying shares in this secondary sale.\\\\nSale details\\\\nNo additional capital to be raised\\\\nThe proposed secondary sale will not see Zepto raising any additional capital. Rather, it will give employees and some existing investors a chance to convert their shares into cash.\\\\nThe company expects to close these transactions at a valuation of just over $5 billion, in line with its last funding round held late last year.\\\\nOwnership increase\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s strategy to boost Indian investor ownership\\\\nThe secondary sale comes as part of Zepto\\\\\\'s larger plan to increase Indian investor ownership ahead of its IPO.\\\\nCurrently, Indian shareholders own nearly 33% of Zepto\\\\\\'s cap table. The company\\\\\\'s founders Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra own nearly a fifth of the firm.\\\\nThe goal is to increase the overall stake of Indian investors to around 50%.\\\\nStaff motivation\\\\nSecondary stock sales: Controversial yet rewarding\\\\nHistorically, secondary stock sales have been controversial as they can allow managers/employees to cash in before an IPO/sale, reducing their motivation to build the business.\\\\nHowever, they have recently emerged as a way to reward staff and boost morale while allowing investors to realize profits from their investments.\\\\nZepto operates in India\\\\\\'s highly competitive grocery delivery sector, competing against Amazon\\\\\\'s India unit and homegrown rivals Swiggy, Zomato, and BigBasket.\\\\n                \\\\n                Mumbai-based quick commerce startup Zepto is reportedly in advanced discussions to secure $100-million in a funding round, its third major investment round in the past six months. The company aims to raise the capital from Indian family offices and high-net-worth individuals (HNIs), according to sources familiar with the matter.\\\\nAsset management firm Motilal Oswal, which previously invested $40 million in Zepto, is said to be managing the funding mandate. According to sources, Motilal Oswal is investing around $40 million and facilitating an additional $100 million from Indian family offices and other HNIs. Raamdeo Agrawal, chairman and co-founder of Motilal Oswal, is expected to contribute around $15 million in his personal capacity out of the $40 million investment. Agrawal is already an investor in Zepto. “Commitment for about $100 has been received, but the round could go upto $150 million or further,” said a person aware of the developments.\\\\nTalks have been ongoing for about three months and are expected to materialise soon. The new investment is anticipated to value Zepto at a post-money valuation of $5 billion, consistent with its recent $340 million financing round in August. The aim is to increase domestic ownership ahead of the company’s planned initial public offering (IPO) next year, sources said.\\\\nThe company, which popularised ultra fast deliveries of groceries within 10 minutes, has raised approximately $1.6 billion since its inception three years ago. Over $1 billion of this has been secured in the past four months alone. Zepto is also expanding into traditional e-commerce and retail categories like fashion and electronics.\\\\nIt raised $665 million at a valuation of $3.6 billion in June and secured another $340 million at a $5 billion valuation in August.\\\\nInitially based in Singapore, Zepto shifted its headquarters to Mumbai to prepare for public listing. The company is currently in the middle of another shift, this time to Bengaluru, which is expected to complete by mid-November, according to sources.\\\\nZepto has appointed Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Axis Capital as investment bankers for the IPO and is in the process of finalising additional advisors.\\\\nZepto competes directly with other quick commerce players such as Zomato-owned Blinkit, Prosus-backed Swiggy’s Instamart, and Tata’s BigBasket. The quick commerce sector in India is experiencing robust expansion, with projected sales exceeding $6 billion this year. This surge has prompted traditional e-commerce companies like Flipkart, Myntra and Nykaa to accelerate their delivery times to remain competitive.\\\\nThe rise of quick commerce is impacting traditional retailers as well. Shares of D-Mart’s parent company fell this week after the firm acknowledged losing some business to quick commerce startups. Analysts noted that these startups are expanding cities, categories, creating parallel commerce for convenience-seeking customers.\\\\nZepto claims it has increased its annualised net revenue run rate in recent months. In a meeting with investors in August, co-founder and CEO Aadit Palicha projected that the company would grow by 150% over the next 12 months.\\\\nZepto did not immediately respond to requests for comments.\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto, a newcomer to the quick-commerce scene, is starting a big project to raise a lot of money from international investors. This calculated move highlights Zepto’s resolve to broaden its reach and challenge industry titans. Let’s investigate the possible effects of Zepto’s audacious expansion proposal.\\\\nCredits: The Arc\\\\nZepto’s Unique Position:\\\\nZepto is unique in the competitive quick-commerce market because it is the only independently owned and venture-backed business. Zepto’s independence gives it the agility and flexibility to quickly adjust to changes in the market, unlike its competitors who are controlled by larger corporations. Zepto has a competitive edge as it negotiates the potential and challenges in the ever changing quick-commerce industry thanks to its distinctive position.\\\\nNavigating the Competitive Landscape:\\\\nZepto is unique in a field crowded with well-established competitors supported by big businesses, being the only independent startup with venture capital funding. Zepto’s distinct positioning gives it a competitive advantage in the quick-commerce space and enables it to respond quickly to market developments.\\\\nMeeting Surging Consumer Demand:\\\\nThe choice to seek at least $300 million in finance is highly appropriate given the current upsurge in consumer demand in the quick-commerce sector, particularly for same-day grocery delivery. Zepto wants to take advantage of this trend by strengthening its service offerings and expanding its infrastructure to better serve its clients’ changing needs.\\\\nChallenging the Titans:\\\\nZepto faces a formidable challenge from industry giants like Instamart, Blinkit, and BigBasket, which boast substantial resources and corporate backing. To level the playing field, Zepto seeks investors capable of leading multiple funding rounds, empowering it to scale up operations and compete more effectively in the cutthroat quick-commerce arena.\\\\nFinancial Performance and Strategic Growth:\\\\nDespite encountering hurdles, Zepto has showcased remarkable operational efficiency and a notable reduction in EBITDA losses over a relatively short period. With a sharp improvement in its EBITDA margin and plans to achieve break-even soon, Zepto is primed for sustainable growth and profitability.\\\\nDiversification for Market Dominance:\\\\nZepto’s expansion beyond grocery delivery into product categories like apparel, gifting, and baby care reflects a strategic move to diversify its revenue streams. By mirroring its competitors’ approach and tapping into segments with higher consumer spending, Zepto aims to capture a larger market share and foster enhanced customer loyalty.\\\\nInnovative Customer Engagement:\\\\nThe launch of Zepto Pass, a membership program with remarkable initial adoption, highlights Zepto’s dedication to innovation and customer-focused business practices. Zepto Pass, which is competitively priced and provides a plethora of perks, is positioned to increase customer retention and develop recurring income streams, making Zepto a leader in the quickly changing quick-commerce space.\\\\nStrategic Brand Building:\\\\nRecognizing the pivotal role of brand building and customer loyalty in a fiercely competitive environment, Zepto has allocated resources towards marketing endeavors. By cultivating a robust brand identity and nurturing customer trust, Zepto endeavors to carve out a distinct niche in the market, setting itself apart from the competition and cultivating a dedicated customer base.\\\\nNavigating Industry Dynamics:\\\\nThe growing popularity of Zepto among businesses such as Blinkit and Instamart suggests a shift in the perception of profitability in the quick-commerce sector—an industry marked by both triumphs and setbacks. But as e-commerce giants like Flipkart and Amazon approach, competition is set to increase, pushing businesses to innovate and adjust to shifting market conditions.\\\\nConclusion:\\\\nIn summary, Zepto’s aggressive quest for significant funds marks the beginning of a new phase in its endeavor to upend the quick-commerce industry. Zepto is well-positioned for rapid expansion and market leadership with a strong emphasis on customer involvement, product variety, and operational efficiency. Redefining the future of quick-commerce is Zepto’s unwavering dedication as it navigates the opportunities and challenges ahead. Zepto’s ambitious goals are a tribute to its unyielding commitment and pioneering spirit in molding the developing narrative of India’s burgeoning quick-commerce ecosystem, as investors and customers alike wait with bated breath.\\\\n                \\\\n                Upcoming IPO: Zepto plans listing!

It had said in June that it has crossed the milestone of $1 billion in terms of annualised GMV.\\\\nBesides dark stores, Zepto also outlined plans to utilise the capital to scale up Zepto Café - its quick-delivery snack and meal service.\\\\nAccording to a report released by Redseer, the quick-commerce market size is projected to reach about $6 billion GMV (gross merchandise value) by FY25, with expected growth rates of 75-85 per cent. This will be driven by 5 million new monthly transacting users (MTU), it added.\\\\nPublished on November 15, 2024\\\\nComments\\\\nComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

A lot of innovative steps have been taken by the company to support and boost its business growth. Zepto\\\\\\'s target audience is generally young adults and the modern generation. Here is the detailed overview you must read.\\\\n10-Mins Delivery Strategy\\\\nThe idea of online grocery delivery is not new. Startups like Dunzo and Blinkit are already providing these services. The fact that distinguishes Zepto from all its competitors is its 10-minute delivery of groceries and other products. You might have heard about Zomato Instant, which provides food delivery within 10 minutes, but Zepto is the first player in the grocery delivery segment to offer a 10-minute grocery delivery service.\\\\nThe idea of 10-minute grocery delivery is unique, but it was not that easy to implement. To fulfill its promise to deliver groceries in the specified time, Zepto introduced the concept of the dark store model. The dark store is like a fulfillment center for Zepto; it is not accessible to the public but is efficient enough to fulfill orders rapidly.\\\\nArtificial intelligence is used by Zepto to pick, pack, and transport orders in leaps and bounds. Whenever any customer places an order, a person with a tablet is assigned to pick up and pack the order within 60 seconds. It means that at the time you make the payment, someone is already preparing your order for dispatch. The company claims that 8 minutes and 40 seconds is the average delivery time they have achieved.\\\\nZepto operates its dark store delivery within a 3 km radius, and it doesn\\\\\\'t penalize its delivery boy for late delivery.\\\\nDiscounts are a way to attract customers, but as a new player in the segment, offering huge discounts was not a sustainable option for Zepto. Hence, the 10-minute delivery strategy comes out to be a panacea for Zepto.\\\\nAdvertising and Branding Strategy\\\\nThere is not only one thing responsible for the success of Zepto, but an incredible advertising strategy has also played an important role in the success. L&K Saatchi and Saatchi is an advertising agency that was assigned to advertise Zepto and build a strong brand image in front of consumers. The main theme of all the ads is to emphasize the 10-minute delivery of Zepto.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s ads are attention-grabbing ads that suddenly capture the focus, and this is what every brand wants. When a boy suddenly wakes up and runs toward the door, it creates a question in the minds of viewers about why he is running. The twist and excitement of the ad make it capable of grabbing the attention of viewers.\\\\nIf I try to summarize the above ad in a single sentence, then it is like this: From the time you wake up until the time you sleep, every essential product will get delivered to your doorstep within 10 minutes.\\\\nEach ad that was created is meant to make the consumer feel how Zepto is capable of changing their daily grocery shopping habit. Since advertising is the best way to market the product and build a strong brand image, Zepto has fully utilized the benefits of marketing.\\\\nAdvertising was not only done on social media channels, but it also planted its hoardings in the streets of cities in which Zepto\\\\\\'s services are operational.\\\\nSocial Media Meme Marketing\\\\nIn today\\\\\\'s generation of technology and innovation, we cannot ignore the power of social media. There is a huge chance you\\\\\\'ll find your target audience on the social media platform. Hence, every brand is focusing on social media marketing. Zepto is also not behind the race; it leverages the social platform to engage its audience through meme marketing.\\\\nFor the recently released movie \\\\\\'Avatar: The Way of Water,\\\\\\' Zepto created a meme to grab the consumer\\\\\\'s attention by following the ongoing trend. It\\\\\\'s just one example, but if you visit Zepto\\\\\\'s social media page, you\\\\\\'ll find plenty of such memes.\\\\nMeme marketing is a trend today because people often share memes with their loved ones. This will help the brand get some organic reach and, at the same time, promote the brand. Zepto knows the power of memes very well. That\\\\\\'s why if you open their page on any platform like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, you\\\\\\'ll find amazing memes.\\\\nTh has gained a lot of positive feedback from customers. Along with meme marketing, they sometimes collaborate with famous social media influencers to make videos for them. This tactic helps to create a loyal fanbase and also helps the brand image flourish.\\\\nMicro-Moments Marketing Strategy\\\\nMicro-moments are key moments in a customer\\\\\\'s journey where brands can influence buying decisions. Zepto understands this and focuses on sending the right messages at the right time to connect with customers. Studies show that over 150 billion mobile micro-moments happen every day, influencing more than 70% of purchases. Brands using this approach see a 74% success rate in increasing revenue.\\\\nCustomer Acquisition and Retention Strategy\\\\nPlayers in the quick commerce industry like Dunzo, Swiggy Instamart, and Blinkit are well-funded and established. These big giants have already acquired a huge market share in the segment by offering huge discounts and other offers. So it was not easy for Zepto to acquire customers and retain them.\\\\nDiscounts are not the only things that attract consumers. Consumers are always hungry for something new, and exactly here, Zepto played its game. Acquisition of customers and retaining customers are two different things. Other players in the segment have easily acquired customers but struggled to retain them.\\\\nCustomers are used to switching platforms and ordering items from the app, where the discount is heavy. In the case of Zepto, it has given discounts and at the same time provided high-speed free delivery. It helps to enhance Zepto\\\\\\'s retention rate significantly.\\\\nNo other players in the segment were making that fast delivery. This eventually leads to an increase in Zepto\\\\\\'s consumer base.\\\\nDigital Marketing\\\\nZepto uses digital marketing to reach busy customers with fast and targeted ads. They focus on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook to promote quick delivery and special offers. Zepto also uses precision messaging or micro-moments to engage customers when they are likely to make a purchase. Through online campaigns, Zepto builds brand awareness and encourages customers to use their service for fast grocery deliveries.\\\\nReferral Programs\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s referral program plays a crucial role in its successful marketing strategy. The program offers unique codes to its users for sharing, which incentivizes both existing and new users with rewards such as discounts. This helps in cost-effective customer acquisition and increases customer retention. The program\\\\\\'s seamless integration with social media, multiple reward options, and gamification elements make it a dynamic and impactful tool for Zepto\\\\\\'s growth and customer loyalty.\\\\nBeyond transactional benefits, Zepto\\\\\\'s referral initiative is a brand-building powerhouse, fostering advocacy and community engagement. By creating a positive customer experience and utilizing word-of-mouth influence, the program stands as a testament to the brand\\\\\\'s commitment to customer satisfaction and strategic marketing prowess.\\\\nPartnerships with Influencers\\\\nZepto partners with social media influencers who create authentic content to showcase its services. This helps Zepto build trust, connect with specific audiences, and reach more customers. This approach has fueled rapid growth, with the company raising over $300 million in just one year, emphasizing its focus on long-term customer relationships.\\\\nMarketing Campaign of Zepto\\\\nboAt, India’s leading audio brand, has teamed up with Zepto to bring high-quality audio products to your doorstep in just 10 minutes.

Outdoor advertising will be prominently displayed across major cities where Zepto operates, ensuring widespread visibility and engagement.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s \\\\\\'Nahi Milega\\\\\\' brand campaign underscores its commitment, emphasizing that while life may present unattainable challenges, unlimited free deliveries on Zepto are certain.\\\\nZepto adopted an unconventional approach by introducing Uncle Ji, a character from Delhi, several weeks before unveiling their brand campaign. The intention was to disrupt social media with Uncle Ji\\\\\\'s distinctive personality, straightforward expressions of reality, and the recurring catchphrase \\\\\\'Nahi Milega\\\\\\' (won\\\\\\'t be available).\\\\nZepto said Uncle Ji\\\\\\'s character achieved remarkable organic traction, accumulating 10 million impressions with a substantial 10% engagement rate across all social media platforms. Uncle Ji trended at #6 on Twitter and received endorsements from popular Twitter celebrities and Instagram meme pages, solidifying his status as a cultural icon in India.\\\\nZepto USP\\\\nZepto’s business model focuses on customers and offers instant delivery, setting it apart from competitors.

Promotion: Building a Strong Brand Identity\\\\nZepto’s promotional strategy is diverse and impactful, utilizing both traditional and digital channels to establish a strong brand presence. A key component of its promotional efforts is its focus on advertising and branding. Partnering with the advertising agency L&K Saatchi and Saatchi, Zepto created campaigns that emphasize its unique 10-minute delivery promise. The brand’s ads are designed to captivate and engage viewers by highlighting everyday situations where time is of the essence, ultimately showcasing how Zepto can solve this problem with its rapid delivery service.\\\\nAdditionally, Zepto has adopted social media meme marketing, a clever and engaging way to reach younger audiences. By creating memes around current events, pop culture, and trending topics, Zepto has been able to connect with its audience in a light-hearted, relatable manner. This not only helps the brand stay relevant but also builds a strong community around its product.\\\\nThe 10-Minute Delivery Strategy: A Game-Changer\\\\nWhen Zepto entered the market, it was not the first company to offer online grocery delivery. However, it was the first to promise deliveries in just 10 minutes—a unique selling point that set the brand apart from the competition. In the highly competitive world of quick commerce, speed is everything. Zepto’s 10-minute delivery service has proven to be its defining feature, allowing it to attract a loyal customer base.\\\\nAchieving such rapid delivery times is no easy feat. To fulfill its promise, Zepto relies on the dark store model, which enables efficient packing and dispatching of orders. Once a customer places an order, the system ensures that it is picked, packed, and dispatched within a minute. Zepto also uses advanced technology, including artificial intelligence, to streamline the entire process, from inventory management to delivery logistics. With an average delivery time of just 8 minutes and 47 seconds, Zepto is living up to its commitment of ultra-fast service.\\\\nAdvertising and Branding: Creating Buzz and Building Trust\\\\nZepto’s advertising strategy is another key factor that has contributed to its success. Through clever, engaging campaigns, the company has been able to capture the public’s attention and create a strong brand identity. One of its most successful campaigns featured the idea of waiting—something we all do in everyday life, whether it’s waiting in line at an airport or waiting for food at a restaurant. In the campaign, Zepto cleverly juxtaposes the frustration of waiting with its promise of 10-minute delivery, showing that while many things in life take time, Zepto’s service doesn’t.\\\\nBeyond traditional ads, Zepto also made waves with its innovative use of meme marketing. By leveraging the power of humor and social media trends, Zepto has created a relatable, fun brand that resonates with younger audiences. This approach not only garners attention but also promotes organic engagement, as users share Zepto’s memes across their networks.\\\\nCustomer Acquisition and Retention: Building Loyalty with Speed and Service\\\\nOne of the challenges for Zepto in such a competitive market was acquiring and retaining customers. While discounts and offers can attract new users, they don’t necessarily ensure long-term loyalty. Zepto, however, focuses on creating a unique experience that keeps customers coming back. The company’s commitment to ultra-fast delivery, combined with its excellent customer service, has led to impressive customer retention rates.\\\\nZepto also leverages referral programs to drive customer acquisition. The referral system rewards existing users for referring new customers, making it an effective strategy for growing its user base. By offering incentives for both the referrer and the referee, Zepto ensures that customers are motivated to spread the word about the service.\\\\nZepto’s Unique Selling Proposition (USP)\\\\nWhat truly sets Zepto apart from its competitors is its ability to deliver groceries in 10 minutes without compromising on the quality or price of the products. This quick delivery model, coupled with free shipping, offers customers a compelling reason to choose Zepto over other grocery delivery services, many of which charge for delivery. Zepto’s ability to maintain competitive prices while offering faster service has made it a preferred choice for urban dwellers.\\\\nConclusion: A Rising Star in Quick Commerce\\\\nZepto’s meteoric rise in the quick commerce industry is a testament to the power of innovation, speed, and smart marketing. By focusing on customer needs—specifically, the desire for speed and convenience—Zepto has carved out a niche in a crowded market. With a combination of creative advertising, meme marketing, and an unbeatable delivery speed, Zepto has become the go-to app for time-conscious consumers.\\\\nIn a short time, Zepto has achieved what many of its competitors have struggled to do: build a loyal customer base, establish a strong brand identity, and deliver on its promises.

The best part of Zepto marketing strategy is the 10-minute guarantee delivery. As a result, you can get groceries delivered to your doorstep that you previously purchased from the local general store.\\\\nWhat is Zepto? What Types of Companies Comes Under the Zepto Marketing Strategy?\\\\nZepto offers service only through the official application. At present, it has more than 80 dark stores throughout the country. These stores are primarily in tier one cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, and more. Zepto is a pan-India company that started its operations in April 2021. However, it was founded in September 2020.\\\\nThe primary reason Zepto has a successful business model in India is that Zepto marketing strategy includes producing 2500+ goods within 10 minutes. As a result, it was impossible for any top delivery or e-commerce sites.\\\\nWhether it is the marketing strategy of Zepto or any other marketing strategy, there are a lot of crucial factors. The idea is one of the most important ones of them. The Story of Zepto starts when the two founders, who were studying computer science, got tempted with their creative idea to start a business.\\\\nWith the idea to deliver food to your doorsteps in the least possible time, Zepto was introduced. The most crucial thing was that Zepto was introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the strict lockdown, when people were striving hard to get out of their homes, the founders worked hard to make the delivery possible even during the restrictions.\\\\nHow does Zepto Delivery Work? A Detail on Zepto Business Model\\\\nThe Zepto business model was inspired by the idea on which KiranaKart depends. KiranaKart depends on is for the local shopkeepers and managers. They deliver the goods and products within 45 minutes of placing the order. Zepto marketing strategy is based on similar ideas. Both the founders were bachelors, and they had to struggle a lot to get food delivered. This is where they got the idea of creating such an app that quickly provides grocery items.\\\\nAlso Read: 8 Compelling Reasons to Invest in a Grocery App Development Company\\\\nTheir vision is to open Zepto Dark stores all over India and expand the brand at the top level. They are planning to increase the team from 400 to 800 by 2023. You must think that Zepto app is the only company to be the fastest delivery online shopping app. At the same time, they are facing intense competition from rival companies like Swiggy, Zomato, Blinkit and Dunzo. The best part is all the competitors are offering the same service at equal rates.\\\\nTherefore, it was not easy to stay in the top place. Zepto marketing strategy required more business skills and investment to be the fastest delivery app in India. They introduced new standards to transform their work in the delivery infrastructure – right from the basic level. In simple words, ground-level work was still needed.\\\\nFunding & Investment for Zepto Marketing Strategy\\\\nThe leading sources for Zepto’s funds are Y combinator community funds and Glade brook capital partners. Both invested 100 million dollars and 4.4 billion rupees, respectively. Zepto has a successful business model in India, showing continuous growth. You can see the Zepto marketing strategy’s success from the number of stores they have opened across cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune and more.\\\\nAs the fastest delivery app in India, Zepto delivers grocery items only in the stores’ available areas. The technical office is in Bangalore. This is where all the technicalities are handled, while the operations are done from the Mumbai office. So, if you ask if the supermarket business is profitable in India, we will say YES. Why? Popular apps like Flipkart, Uber, Dream11 and more have their key executives in the Zepto app. Recently, Lazypay and Pescafresh partnered with Zepto.\\\\nZepto Talent Acquisition\\\\nAnother important thing that has worked in favour of a successful Zepto marketing strategy is acquiring talent. Top executives decided to join Zepto because it allowed so many people that had shifted to Bangalore to come back to Mumbai. However, the fast growth of the start-up, its ambition and the disciplined execution encouraged several people to be attracted to the company.\\\\nOrder Volume Claims\\\\nBlinkit & Instamart claimed that their weekly order volume increased to more than a million. So, the question is, what about Zepto? How many orders are they delivering now? Well, Zepto is not too keen to publish the numbers. However, they are saying that with the current numbers, they shall easily surpass the competitors in the market.\\\\nZepto Business Model: Dark Store Model\\\\nDark stores might seem a sinister option, but it is a great idea that helped multiple retail businesses stay afloat throughout the pandemic. The dark stores are distribution outlets that are not open to visitors. These are micro warehouses that quickly and accurately fulfil orders. Therefore, they offer shoppers resources and options like buying products online, pickup in-store and same-day delivery.\\\\nAccording to the founders and shareholders of the Zepto app, the magic of the dark store model is how they became the fastest delivery app in India. With the help of the dark stores, they could pick, pack, and dispatch the goods within 60 seconds. However, the last section is just like any other delivery model.\\\\nSuch a grocery delivery model is implemented in developed nations; however, the model was never explored in India. The dark store model reduces the trivial challenges that any delivery service faces. These include navigation, traffic congestion, and connectivity.\\\\nZepto marketing strategy used geography, location intelligence, population, road patterns, traffic dynamics, last-minute supply availability, weather, real estate values and others. All these factors improved the network’s overall performance.\\\\nDark stores are meant for instant deliveries and can’t handle the sales volume. However, the Zepto grocery app didn’t compromise on the shortcomings of this model. They have thousands of products on display, fresh produce, meat, milk, kitchen refills and more at the best bargain. Also, the AI-powered tool ensures a smooth transition, right from picking, packing, and delivering. All these features make the Zepto grocery app the fastest online shopping app.\\\\nBenefits of Zepto Business Model\\\\nThere are a lot of benefits to the Zepto Business Model.

The best thing about these stores is they are always online to take orders. It is what brings consumers to such platforms and uses their services. Therefore, it is one of the essential features that made the successful Zepto marketing strategy.\\\\n3. Contactless Shopping\\\\nThere is no denying the fact that the need for contact-free shopping is a critical factor for businesses to adopt the “dark store” approach. The dark stores allow consumers to purchase groceries in a contactless way without entering a physical store. All you must do is place orders, and you will get them instantly.\\\\n4. Better Inventory Control and Product Assortment\\\\nZepto’s business model and Zepto marketing strategy worked because they chose dark stores.

Also, the AI-powered tools keep the inventory stock track and provide product assortment.\\\\nZepto’s USP\\\\nZepto’s business model is customer-centric, and it is an instant delivery model.

They are capable enough to fulfill the grocery delivery in 10 minutes. Also, they claim to have a delivery time of 8 minutes and 47 seconds.\\\\nAccording to the founders, when a user checks the order, it is already shipped out for delivery. Therefore, it is another essential element that makes Zepto marketing strategy successful. They fulfill almost every order within 10 minutes. Only one percent of the charges might take 15-16 minutes.\\\\nAnother crucial factor for successful business models in India is to offer free shipping. Zepto offers free shipping. Even though this USP has got dim compared to the former one, it still doesn’t charge a delivery fee. On the other hand, Amazon Fresh & Instacart have delivery fees.\\\\nYou must remember that the free service doesn’t mean costlier products. Yet another USP is that it offers excellent discounts on its list of products and groceries.\\\\nZepto’s Online Ad Campaigns\\\\nZepto marketing campaigns are one of the best ones you shall see in the ad campaigns of recent companies. Zepto witnessed growth primarily because of its unique ad campaigns online. All of this they achieved in a short time. Did you know?

It is where Zepto ad campaigns have stood apart.\\\\nHere are examples of the Zepto marketing strategy ad campaign where they surprisingly used three famous singers.

The company uses sophisticated algorithms to optimize delivery routes, ensuring timely deliveries while minimizing fuel consumption. This not only enhances efficiency but also reduces operational costs.\\\\nStrong relationships with suppliers are crucial for maintaining a reliable supply chain. Zepto works closely with its suppliers to ensure a steady and timely supply of products. The company also negotiates favorable terms with suppliers to keep costs low and pass on the savings to customers.\\\\nCustomer feedback is invaluable for continuous improvement. Zepto has implemented robust feedback mechanisms that allow customers to share their experiences and suggestions. The company uses this feedback to make necessary adjustments and improve its services.\\\\nTo retain customers and encourage repeat purchases, Zepto offers loyalty programs. These programs reward customers for their continued patronage, often through discounts, exclusive offers, and early access to new products. Loyalty programs help build long-term relationships with customers and increase their lifetime value.\\\\nZepto has raised significant funding from various investors, allowing it to expand its operations and invest in technology. The company’s funding rounds have seen participation from prominent venture capital firms, reflecting investor confidence in Zepto’s business model and growth potential.\\\\nZepto’s primary revenue stream comes from the sale of groceries and essentials. The company also explores additional revenue streams, such as premium memberships and advertising partnerships, to diversify its income sources.\\\\nZepto adopts a strategic approach to geographic expansion. The company carefully selects new markets based on factors like population density, consumer behavior, and competitive landscape. This phased approach ensures that each new location is well-integrated into Zepto’s overall network.\\\\nIn addition to groceries and essentials, Zepto explores opportunities for product diversification. This includes adding new categories like household items, personal care products, and even ready-to-eat meals. Product diversification helps Zepto cater to a broader customer base and increase its market share.\\\\nThe quick commerce industry is poised for continued growth, driven by changing consumer behaviors and advancements in technology. Companies that can innovate and adapt to these trends will be well-positioned for success. Key trends to watch include the integration of AI and automation, the rise of sustainable practices, and the increasing importance of customer experience.\\\\nDespite its growth potential, the quick commerce industry faces several challenges.

As the quick commerce landscape continues to evolve, Zepto’s ability to adapt and innovate will be key to its sustained success.\\\\nAkshat’s passion for marketing and dedication to helping others has been the driving force behind AkshatSinghBisht.com. Known for his insightful perspectives, practical advice, and unwavering commitment to his audience, Akshat is a trusted voice in the marketing community.\\\\nIf you have any questions simply use the following contact details.\\\\n                \\\\n                If there’s one thing Zepto excels at—besides making deliveries at lightning-fast speeds—it’s crafting standout ads.\\\\nLaunched in 2021, the quick commerce platform initially made its mark by delivering groceries in just 10 minutes. Over time, Zepto expanded into new categories, including electronics, sports essentials, skincare, footwear, and more. To highlight its growing product range, the platform regularly rolls out fresh ad campaigns for various brands.\\\\nDevargh Mukherjee, senior creative manager at Zepto, sheds light on the strategy behind crafting a steady stream of witty and impactful ads. Since joining in September 2024, he has been a part of more than 50 ads launched in just six months! What sets these campaigns apart is their originality—each ad remains engaging, relatable, and tailored to the right audience without feeling repetitive.\\\\nUnlike traditional agencies, where ideas go through endless rounds of approvals, Zepto’s process is super-fast. “We know we have only 30 seconds of a consumer’s time. Our biggest audience is our customers. So, we just want to entertain and sell—nothing else,” says Mukherjee.\\\\nThe in-house creative model allows them to move swiftly. “We don’t have to go through multiple layers of approvals. At agencies, you have to deal with account managers, creative directors, and CEOs—it’s a long, tedious process. Here, we only need the approval of a few individuals to proceed.\" This streamlined approach means that Zepto can ideate, shoot, and release an ad within a week—sometimes even in just four to five days.\\\\nSecondly, instead of juggling with multiple vendors, Zepto works with one dedicated production house—Third Floor Films—that streamlines the entire process. “Since they know work is always coming, they’ve built an efficient system—scripting, shooting, grading, and editing all happen seamlessly.”\\\\nThe qDASDASDAuick commerce company chooses a few brands for each category video, but how do they really choose brands? Mukherjee reveals that strategy involves partnerships with relevant brands to enhance category growth and mutual benefit. So whenever the company thinks of making a new film, they simply ask brands who are interested to be a part of it, and they have a lineup already.\\\\nThe key to this cost efficiency lies in Zepto’s streamlined approach. Unlike agencies that outsource various elements of production, Zepto keeps everything in-house, ensuring consistency while cutting costs.\\\\nZepto’s cost-efficient model enables them to create brand films, go-to-market campaigns, and performance ads within the same budget.\\\\n“We pick brands that will grow our category and have fun working with us. Moreover, the ads we make with them aren’t something they would typically create for their platforms. With us, they have the opportunity to experiment with a different tone.\"\\\\nFor instance, Whisper usually makes long-formatted conversational ads, but with Zepto, they agreed to do it in a different way. Similarly, the Honasa sunscreen ad played on the fear of the sun like a horror film, making it dramatically different from conventional sunscreen ads.\\\\nWhile Zepto’s approach is fun and unconventional, not every brand immediately buys in; Zepto isn\\\\\\'t an agency that will keep pitching ideas one after the other, after all.\\\\nCollaboration is the key here, and the brand does come up with good ideas too. “For the Surf Excel Holi film, someone from the brand side suggested making the Zepto delivery guy the hero of the story. We took the feedback, rewrote the script, and it worked beautifully.”\\\\nDespite producing over 50 films in various genres, the company doesn\\\\\\'t have a brand ambassador. Probably because the guy in the purple uniform delivering the products has all the spotlight. Unlike most e-commerce ads where the delivery person is just a background character, Zepto has turned its riders into a brand identity.\\\\n“Our guy isn’t just a delivery person—he’s part of the fun. In the Eno ad with Anurag Kashyap, he got a fist bump. In the Honasa film, he was chilling in the pool at the end. In the ID Fresh Food film, he was casually having breakfast while the maid cooked. We make sure he has a role beyond just handing over a bag,” Mukherjee explains.\\\\nZepto carefully selects celebrities who feel authentic to the brand; they don’t heavily rely on celebrities and influencers for marketing. For example, while it’s hard to imagine SRK buying groceries, Akshay Kumar seems like someone who actually would, making him a natural fit.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s ads prioritise performance over virality, focusing on content that directly appeals to consumers rather than aiming for massive online trends. Moreover, they tailor the content based on where it\\\\\\'s being posted.\\\\nFor storytelling on platforms such as LinkedIn and Instagram, longer cuts are used, while for performance marketing, shorter (6–10-second) versions are taken out. The scripting process is designed for flexibility—each film is structured scene by scene, so editors can seamlessly cut from one point to another without losing coherence.\\\\nWith another four to five ads ready to roll out soon, Zepto isn’t slowing down anytime soon. Their secret? Speed, creative freedom, and a knack for finding humour in everyday life.\\\\nMukherjee sums it up best: “We’re here to have fun, make you laugh, and get you to order from Zepto. Simple.”\\\\n                \\\\n                Zepto, a Mumbai-based grocery delivery startup, has rapidly captured attention since its inception in 2021, fueled by its innovative approach to quick commerce and instant grocery delivery.

A lot of innovative steps have been taken by the company to support and boost its business growth. Zepto\\\\\\'s target audience is generally young adults and the modern generation. Here is the detailed overview you must read.\\\\n10-Mins Delivery Strategy\\\\nThe idea of online grocery delivery is not new. Startups like Dunzo and Blinkit are already providing these services. The fact that distinguishes Zepto from all its competitors is its 10-minute delivery of groceries and other products. You might have heard about Zomato Instant, which provides food delivery within 10 minutes, but Zepto is the first player in the grocery delivery segment to offer a 10-minute grocery delivery service.\\\\nThe idea of 10-minute grocery delivery is unique, but it was not that easy to implement. To fulfill its promise to deliver groceries in the specified time, Zepto introduced the concept of the dark store model. The dark store is like a fulfillment center for Zepto; it is not accessible to the public but is efficient enough to fulfill orders rapidly.\\\\nArtificial intelligence is used by Zepto to pick, pack, and transport orders in leaps and bounds. Whenever any customer places an order, a person with a tablet is assigned to pick up and pack the order within 60 seconds. It means that at the time you make the payment, someone is already preparing your order for dispatch. The company claims that 8 minutes and 40 seconds is the average delivery time they have achieved.\\\\nZepto operates its dark store delivery within a 3 km radius, and it doesn\\\\\\'t penalize its delivery boy for late delivery.\\\\nDiscounts are a way to attract customers, but as a new player in the segment, offering huge discounts was not a sustainable option for Zepto. Hence, the 10-minute delivery strategy comes out to be a panacea for Zepto.\\\\nAdvertising and Branding Strategy\\\\nThere is not only one thing responsible for the success of Zepto, but an incredible advertising strategy has also played an important role in the success. L&K Saatchi and Saatchi is an advertising agency that was assigned to advertise Zepto and build a strong brand image in front of consumers. The main theme of all the ads is to emphasize the 10-minute delivery of Zepto.\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s ads are attention-grabbing ads that suddenly capture the focus, and this is what every brand wants. When a boy suddenly wakes up and runs toward the door, it creates a question in the minds of viewers about why he is running. The twist and excitement of the ad make it capable of grabbing the attention of viewers.\\\\nIf I try to summarize the above ad in a single sentence, then it is like this: From the time you wake up until the time you sleep, every essential product will get delivered to your doorstep within 10 minutes.\\\\nEach ad that was created is meant to make the consumer feel how Zepto is capable of changing their daily grocery shopping habit. Since advertising is the best way to market the product and build a strong brand image, Zepto has fully utilized the benefits of marketing.\\\\nAdvertising was not only done on social media channels, but it also planted its hoardings in the streets of cities in which Zepto\\\\\\'s services are operational.\\\\nSocial Media Meme Marketing\\\\nIn today\\\\\\'s generation of technology and innovation, we cannot ignore the power of social media. There is a huge chance you\\\\\\'ll find your target audience on the social media platform. Hence, every brand is focusing on social media marketing. Zepto is also not behind the race; it leverages the social platform to engage its audience through meme marketing.\\\\nFor the recently released movie \\\\\\'Avatar: The Way of Water,\\\\\\' Zepto created a meme to grab the consumer\\\\\\'s attention by following the ongoing trend. It\\\\\\'s just one example, but if you visit Zepto\\\\\\'s social media page, you\\\\\\'ll find plenty of such memes.\\\\nMeme marketing is a trend today because people often share memes with their loved ones. This will help the brand get some organic reach and, at the same time, promote the brand. Zepto knows the power of memes very well. That\\\\\\'s why if you open their page on any platform like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, you\\\\\\'ll find amazing memes.\\\\nTh has gained a lot of positive feedback from customers. Along with meme marketing, they sometimes collaborate with famous social media influencers to make videos for them. This tactic helps to create a loyal fanbase and also helps the brand image flourish.\\\\nMicro-Moments Marketing Strategy\\\\nMicro-moments are key moments in a customer\\\\\\'s journey where brands can influence buying decisions. Zepto understands this and focuses on sending the right messages at the right time to connect with customers. Studies show that over 150 billion mobile micro-moments happen every day, influencing more than 70% of purchases. Brands using this approach see a 74% success rate in increasing revenue.\\\\nCustomer Acquisition and Retention Strategy\\\\nPlayers in the quick commerce industry like Dunzo, Swiggy Instamart, and Blinkit are well-funded and established. These big giants have already acquired a huge market share in the segment by offering huge discounts and other offers. So it was not easy for Zepto to acquire customers and retain them.\\\\nDiscounts are not the only things that attract consumers. Consumers are always hungry for something new, and exactly here, Zepto played its game. Acquisition of customers and retaining customers are two different things. Other players in the segment have easily acquired customers but struggled to retain them.\\\\nCustomers are used to switching platforms and ordering items from the app, where the discount is heavy. In the case of Zepto, it has given discounts and at the same time provided high-speed free delivery. It helps to enhance Zepto\\\\\\'s retention rate significantly.\\\\nNo other players in the segment were making that fast delivery. This eventually leads to an increase in Zepto\\\\\\'s consumer base.\\\\nDigital Marketing\\\\nZepto uses digital marketing to reach busy customers with fast and targeted ads. They focus on social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook to promote quick delivery and special offers. Zepto also uses precision messaging or micro-moments to engage customers when they are likely to make a purchase. Through online campaigns, Zepto builds brand awareness and encourages customers to use their service for fast grocery deliveries.\\\\nReferral Programs\\\\nZepto\\\\\\'s referral program plays a crucial role in its successful marketing strategy. The program offers unique codes to its users for sharing, which incentivizes both existing and new users with rewards such as discounts. This helps in cost-effective customer acquisition and increases customer retention. The program\\\\\\'s seamless integration with social media, multiple reward options, and gamification elements make it a dynamic and impactful tool for Zepto\\\\\\'s growth and customer loyalty.\\\\nBeyond transactional benefits, Zepto\\\\\\'s referral initiative is a brand-building powerhouse, fostering advocacy and community engagement. By creating a positive customer experience and utilizing word-of-mouth influence, the program stands as a testament to the brand\\\\\\'s commitment to customer satisfaction and strategic marketing prowess.\\\\nPartnerships with Influencers\\\\nZepto partners with social media influencers who create authentic content to showcase its services. This helps Zepto build trust, connect with specific audiences, and reach more customers. This approach has fueled rapid growth, with the company raising over $300 million in just one year, emphasizing its focus on long-term customer relationships.\\\\nMarketing Campaign of Zepto\\\\nboAt, India’s leading audio brand, has teamed up with Zepto to bring high-quality audio products to your doorstep in just 10 minutes. This partnership combines boAt’s top-notch audio expertise with Zepto’s quick delivery, making it easier to enjoy music, movies, podcasts, and more.

Three ads have been created for this campaign with the voices of these three singers. They have stretched the time with their voices in such a way that it shows our habit of waiting.

Different delivery apps and startups are bringing in other methods.\\\\nIn this blog today, we will discuss the marketing strategy of Zepto – one of the most prominent grocery delivery apps of the present time. The best part of Zepto marketing strategy is the 10-minute guarantee delivery. As a result, you can get groceries delivered to your doorstep that you previously purchased from the local general store.\\\\nWhat is Zepto? What Types of Companies Comes Under the Zepto Marketing Strategy?\\\\nZepto offers service only through the official application. At present, it has more than 80 dark stores throughout the country. These stores are primarily in tier one cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, and more. Zepto is a pan-India company that started its operations in April 2021. However, it was founded in September 2020.\\\\nThe primary reason Zepto has a successful business model in India is that Zepto marketing strategy includes producing 2500+ goods within 10 minutes. As a result, it was impossible for any top delivery or e-commerce sites.\\\\nWhether it is the marketing strategy of Zepto or any other marketing strategy, there are a lot of crucial factors. The idea is one of the most important ones of them. The Story of Zepto starts when the two founders, who were studying computer science, got tempted with their creative idea to start a business.\\\\nWith the idea to deliver food to your doorsteps in the least possible time, Zepto was introduced. The most crucial thing was that Zepto was introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic. During the strict lockdown, when people were striving hard to get out of their homes, the founders worked hard to make the delivery possible even during the restrictions.\\\\nHow does Zepto Delivery Work? A Detail on Zepto Business Model\\\\nThe Zepto business model was inspired by the idea on which KiranaKart depends. KiranaKart depends on is for the local shopkeepers and managers. They deliver the goods and products within 45 minutes of placing the order. Zepto marketing strategy is based on similar ideas. Both the founders were bachelors, and they had to struggle a lot to get food delivered. This is where they got the idea of creating such an app that quickly provides grocery items.\\\\nAlso Read: 8 Compelling Reasons to Invest in a Grocery App Development Company\\\\nTheir vision is to open Zepto Dark stores all over India and expand the brand at the top level. They are planning to increase the team from 400 to 800 by 2023. You must think that Zepto app is the only company to be the fastest delivery online shopping app. At the same time, they are facing intense competition from rival companies like Swiggy, Zomato, Blinkit and Dunzo. The best part is all the competitors are offering the same service at equal rates.\\\\nTherefore, it was not easy to stay in the top place. Zepto marketing strategy required more business skills and investment to be the fastest delivery app in India. They introduced new standards to transform their work in the delivery infrastructure – right from the basic level. In simple words, ground-level work was still needed.\\\\nFunding & Investment for Zepto Marketing Strategy\\\\nThe leading sources for Zepto’s funds are Y combinator community funds and Glade brook capital partners. Both invested 100 million dollars and 4.4 billion rupees, respectively. Zepto has a successful business model in India, showing continuous growth. You can see the Zepto marketing strategy’s success from the number of stores they have opened across cities like Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Pune and more.\\\\nAs the fastest delivery app in India, Zepto delivers grocery items only in the stores’ available areas. The technical office is in Bangalore. This is where all the technicalities are handled, while the operations are done from the Mumbai office. So, if you ask if the supermarket business is profitable in India, we will say YES. Why? Popular apps like Flipkart, Uber, Dream11 and more have their key executives in the Zepto app. Recently, Lazypay and Pescafresh partnered with Zepto.\\\\nZepto Talent Acquisition\\\\nAnother important thing that has worked in favour of a successful Zepto marketing strategy is acquiring talent. Top executives decided to join Zepto because it allowed so many people that had shifted to Bangalore to come back to Mumbai. However, the fast growth of the start-up, its ambition and the disciplined execution encouraged several people to be attracted to the company.\\\\nOrder Volume Claims\\\\nBlinkit & Instamart claimed that their weekly order volume increased to more than a million. So, the question is, what about Zepto? How many orders are they delivering now? Well, Zepto is not too keen to publish the numbers. However, they are saying that with the current numbers, they shall easily surpass the competitors in the market.\\\\nZepto Business Model: Dark Store Model\\\\nDark stores might seem a sinister option, but it is a great idea that helped multiple retail businesses stay afloat throughout the pandemic. The dark stores are distribution outlets that are not open to visitors. These are micro warehouses that quickly and accurately fulfil orders. Therefore, they offer shoppers resources and options like buying products online, pickup in-store and same-day delivery.\\\\nAccording to the founders and shareholders of the Zepto app, the magic of the dark store model is how they became the fastest delivery app in India. With the help of the dark stores, they could pick, pack, and dispatch the goods within 60 seconds. However, the last section is just like any other delivery model.\\\\nSuch a grocery delivery model is implemented in developed nations; however, the model was never explored in India. The dark store model reduces the trivial challenges that any delivery service faces. These include navigation, traffic congestion, and connectivity.\\\\nZepto marketing strategy used geography, location intelligence, population, road patterns, traffic dynamics, last-minute supply availability, weather, real estate values and others. All these factors improved the network’s overall performance.\\\\nDark stores are meant for instant deliveries and can’t handle the sales volume. However, the Zepto grocery app didn’t compromise on the shortcomings of this model. They have thousands of products on display, fresh produce, meat, milk, kitchen refills and more at the best bargain. Also, the AI-powered tool ensures a smooth transition, right from picking, packing, and delivering. All these features make the Zepto grocery app the fastest online shopping app.\\\\nBenefits of Zepto Business Model\\\\nThere are a lot of benefits to the Zepto Business Model. In the following section of the blog, we shall mention a few.\\\\n1. Better Distribution & Faster Delivery\\\\nThe dark store enables Zepto to fulfill orders quickly and more efficiently. In addition, the micro and cold warehouses offer several distribution choices and bring groceries closer to a particular market segment. Thus, you can see that Zepto has higher control over the market spread and distribution. It is another reason why Zepto is the fastest delivery app in India.\\\\n2. Better and Broader Customer Reach\\\\nOne of the dark stores’ most important features is bringing the distribution centres close to the consumers. The best thing about these stores is they are always online to take orders. It is what brings consumers to such platforms and uses their services. Therefore, it is one of the essential features that made the successful Zepto marketing strategy.\\\\n3. Contactless Shopping\\\\nThere is no denying the fact that the need for contact-free shopping is a critical factor for businesses to adopt the “dark store” approach. The dark stores allow consumers to purchase groceries in a contactless way without entering a physical store. All you must do is place orders, and you will get them instantly.\\\\n4. Better Inventory Control and Product Assortment\\\\nZepto’s business model and Zepto marketing strategy worked because they chose dark stores. The dark stores are customer-free zones, and they have better control over the inventory. Therefore, they can easily manage larger order volumes. In addition, the dark stores are designed to ensure easy navigation, allowing the packers to move quickly to pack the items in an order. Also, the AI-powered tools keep the inventory stock track and provide product assortment.\\\\nZepto’s USP\\\\nZepto’s business model is customer-centric, and it is an instant delivery model. However, Zepto offers a few selling points that set it apart from its competitors. Still, these are also included in the model.\\\\nOne of the main reasons the Zepto app is the fastest online shopping app is because Zepto has instant delivery and is regarded as quick commerce. They are capable enough to fulfill the grocery delivery in 10 minutes. Also, they claim to have a delivery time of 8 minutes and 47 seconds.\\\\nAccording to the founders, when a user checks the order, it is already shipped out for delivery. Therefore, it is another essential element that makes Zepto marketing strategy successful. They fulfill almost every order within 10 minutes. Only one percent of the charges might take 15-16 minutes.\\\\nAnother crucial factor for successful business models in India is to offer free shipping. Zepto offers free shipping. Even though this USP has got dim compared to the former one, it still doesn’t charge a delivery fee. On the other hand, Amazon Fresh & Instacart have delivery fees.\\\\nYou must remember that the free service doesn’t mean costlier products. Yet another USP is that it offers excellent discounts on its list of products and groceries.\\\\nZepto’s Online Ad Campaigns\\\\nZepto marketing campaigns are one of the best ones you shall see in the ad campaigns of recent companies. Zepto witnessed growth primarily because of its unique ad campaigns online. All of this they achieved in a short time. Did you know? L&K Saatchi & Saatchi was behind 3 of Zepto’s recent ads.\\\\nThe idea behind all Zepto’s ad campaigns is that time is an expandable commodity in India. Therefore, you cannot afford to waste it. Whether you must board a flight or wait for the food at a restaurant, we all have experienced stretchable time. It is where Zepto ad campaigns have stood apart.\\\\nHere are examples of the Zepto marketing strategy ad campaign where they surprisingly used three famous singers. Usha Uthup, Shankar Mahadevan & Kailash Kher are cast in unusual roles where they must stretch time in their way – thus highlighting the objective of Zepto, which is on-time delivery.\\\\nThe ad campaigns have paved the way for the Zepto app to be the most talked about brand.\\\\nHere’s What Zepto’s Chief Marketing Officer has to Say\\\\nAmritansu Nanda, Chief Marketing Officer of Zepto, says, “Our consumers lead busy, fast-paced lives. At Zepto, through our on-time delivery promise and at the back of our exceptional tech, we constantly strive to let them know and reassure them that we value their time.

Zepto is a case in point. From scripting these to presenting them to producing them, working on the campaign was an absolute pleasure, with the agency and client working as one team completely committed to the product. I think the results speak for themselves.\\\\nIn Conclusion\\\\nZepto marketing strategy has helped the brand to grow as the fastest delivery app in India. Zepto app has plans to expand into newer cities as quickly as possible. They are also planning to increase their coverage to micro-markets and be the leaders in the sector. Several other competitors are trying to participate in the market and grow quickly. However, they cannot promise things like 10-minute delivery consistently.

Just like window shopping, you can select and buy groceries that will be delivered to you. However, most of the delivery services take almost thirty minutes to deliver the product but there is a company that delivers the groceries within 10 minutes after placing the order. That company is none other than “Zepto.”\\\\nHave you ever wondered how Zepto delivers the order so quickly and how it gained its reputation within three years of establishment? The reason behind this success is their impactful and smart business technique. This article provides an explanation of the “Zepto Business Model.”\\\\nThe business model of Zepto consists of three essential components-\\\\n- Working Strategy\\\\n- Marketing Strategy\\\\n- Revenue Sources\\\\nWorking Strategy\\\\nThe main objective of Zepto is to provide the best and quickest service to its customers. The efficient working strategy of Zepto is based on four pillars, namely-\\\\n1: Q- Commerce\\\\nIt stands for quick commerce. It is an instant service model of e-commerce where the marketing and dealings (buying & selling) of products & services occur on the internet. Zepto efficiently utilizes the internet to execute its business. The customers place their orders on the Zepto app and their products are delivered quickly with the help of dark store models or micro markets. It delivers various types of items like fresh produce, snacks, beverages, dry rations, cleaning items, personal care items, etc.\\\\n2: Dark Store Model\\\\nThis is the core working strategy of Zepto. The dark stores are Micro Warehouses (the physical outlets) specially installed for the distribution of the products. These are not open to visitors i.e., you cannot buy the products directly (offline) from the distribution outlets of Zepto. The dark store uses advanced AI-powered technology to perform various tasks ranging from placement of orders, packaging the products, mapping the traffic-free routes for quick delivery routes, and buying fresh grocery items from the bulk distributors. You need to place the order on the Zepto app. Thereafter, their team fulfills the orders and delivers the product to your doorstep.\\\\n3: Key Partners\\\\nThere are three key partners of Zepto- Local Stores, Financial Partners, and Delivery Partners. Zepto buys the groceries in bulk from the local stores and transfers them into the dark stores (micro warehouses). The financial partners aid in the digital payment systems for Zepto. The delivery partners help in the delivery of products from dark stores to customers.\\\\n4: Usage of AI–Powered Technology\\\\nAI-powered technology is the key reason for the smooth working of Zepto. It utilizes location intelligence and geospatial data to determine the target population/audience, geographical location of the customers, patterns of roads, traffic dynamics (to select the roads having less traffic/crowd), supply availability (availability of the products that the customer ordered), weather conditions (for instance, heavy rainfall may disrupt the product delivery), values of the real estate (for establishing a dark store), etc.\\\\nIn short, the customers register and log in to the Zepto app and place an order. The dark store present in the nearest location of the customer receives the notification about the order of the customer. The team present in the dark store packs the item and hands it over to the delivery partner. The delivery man delivers the order to the location of the customer by using the quickest possible route. Finally, the customer receives the product and makes the payments.\\\\nMarketing Strategy\\\\nThe marketing strategy of Zepto mainly involves online Ad campaigns. The ad campaigns of Zepto are one of the best among its competitors. Their advertisements are quirky enough with the tagline of “10-minute delivery” and “zero delivery charges” to hit the target audience and encourage them to use Zepto app. The quick delivery of products within 10 minutes is the USP (Unique Selling Proposition) that helps it stand out among its competitors. Other than ad campaigns, Zepto uses the following marketing strategies-\\\\n- Social Media Marketing\\\\n- Influencer Marketing\\\\n- Television commercials\\\\nRevenue Sources\\\\nThe major revenue of Zepto lies in its “Commission Based Model” and funding rounds.\\\\n- Commissions– It receives a commission of 2-4% on each order placed through its app. These commissions help to cover the costs of the expenditures.\\\\n- Funding Rounds- It raised a significant amount of money through multiple funding rounds. As of today, the value of Zepto is around USD 900 million.\\\\nConclusion\\\\nThe impactful working and marketing strategy of Zepto has played a key role in the success of this quickest-growing startup. It works on a brilliant business model that contributes to the accomplishment of the tasks within the stipulated time.

The company’s success can be attributed to its innovative approach and strategic partnerships. Let’s take a closer look at Zepto’s revenue model and how it generates revenue through its commission fee and delivery fee.\\\\nCommission Fee\\\\nZepto charges a commission fee from the partner grocery stores for every order placed through its app. This fee is calculated as a percentage of the total order value and varies based on the agreement between Zepto and the store. By partnering with a wide range of grocery stores, Zepto ensures a diverse selection of products for its customers while generating revenue through these commission fees.\\\\nDelivery Fee\\\\nIn addition to the commission fee, Zepto may also charge a delivery fee from its customers for the ultra-fast delivery service it provides.

Well, they are \\\\nnot newbies in the start -up world, this is their third start -up after GoPool and Kiranakart.  They came with \\\\nthis ground-breaking idea while sitting in their homes and waiting for their groceries to be delivered in 2 -3 \\\\ndays. Zepto belongs to those start -up subgroups that experienced meteoric development in the post -\\\\nCovid period. This case explains the developme nt process of how the company is making it possible to \\\\ndeliver items in 10 minutes. Zepto has raised $360 million in funding with the lead investors being the \\\\nAmerican start up accelerator company Y Combinator and the American growth equity firm Glade Broo k \\\\nCapital Partners. Currently, the company has a valuation of $900 million. 1 So, the possibility that Zepto  \\\\nwill soon turn into a unicorn is not a daft idea. However, there is a major concern surrounding Zepto’ s \\\\nbusiness model as they have still not made the business profitable. Zepto is also facing tough \\\\ncompetition from its rival Blinkit (formerly known as Grofers) who was founded in December 2013. \\\\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\\\n \\\\nKeywords: Zepto, Start-up, E-commerce, Business Model, Post-Covid. \\\\n___________________________________________________________________________________ \\\\n \\\\nIntroduction \\\\n Zepto is a quick e-commerce company that started its operations in 2021. \\\\n The company started its operations in Bandra, Mumbai and has subsequently extended its \\\\ndelivery areas to Pune, Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Ghaziabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Kolkata. \\\\n On October 31, 2021, a total of 8 investors, led by Glade Brook Capital Partners, invested in \\\\nthem $60 million after which more investors began to notice them. Later, they raised additional funding \\\\nthrough their series C and series D rounds. Y Combinator Continuity Fund became the major investor in \\\\nboth of these rounds. \\\\n The Series C and D rounds were held on December 20, 2021 and May 2, 2022 and raised $100 \\\\nmillion and $200 million respectively2.But Zepto is not the only quick commerce start-up that is backed by \\\\nstrong funding, it is up against fierce competition in India from Blinkit. Blinkit has received backing from \\\\n24 investor s and has gone through a total of 19 fundraising rounds. Blinkit is currently valued at $1 \\\\nbillion3. And then there is also Dunzo which is backed by Google. \\\\nZepto’ s tagline is \"Groceries delivered in 10 minutes”. They do this with the help of Dark stores . \\\\nThey are nothing but warehouses that are not open to the public and are located in such area in the \\\\nneighbourhood where demand is high.Only commonly requested commodities are kept in these \\\\nwarehouses, preventing the loss of unsold stock. Zepto’ s dark st ores are designed in a way so that \\\\norders are filled as rapidly as possible, effectively and efficiently reducing time. Currently, Zepto is \\\\ndelivering 2500+ goods, including food and drink, personal care products, fresh produce, home cleaning \\\\nsupplies, and  snacks and beverages, from its 100+ dark stores. As stated by the CEO of zepto  Aadit \\\\nPalicha the average delivery time taken by Zepto is 8 minutes and 47 seconds. \\\\n \\\\n\\\\uf02a Supervisor, Mentor &Associate Professor, Department of Commerce, Daulat Ram College, University of \\\\nDelhi, Delhi, India. \\\\n**  Student pursuing B.

The company uses artificial intelligence (AI) t o \\\\nenhance the effectiveness of its delivery network by taking into account variables like weather, traffic \\\\npatterns, population, geography, and the availability of last-mile supplies. \\\\n The co-founders have managed to make the roots of the company strong by  getting the best \\\\ntalent out there to work for them when they first started building a team.  They were successful in \\\\npersuading a number of high-profile executives from Dream 11, Amazon, Uber, Pharmeasy, and Flipkart. \\\\n(Source: LinkedIn) \\\\nThese qualified exe cutives have assisted Zepto in achieving unit economics and capital \\\\nefficiency. They are what have allowed Zepto to carve out a place for itself in the grocery’s delivery \\\\nmarket. \\\\nFindings  \\\\nGroceries account for the majority of India\\\\\\'s $1 trillion retail market.1 Consequently, this market \\\\nhas enormous potential. During Corona, it was challenging to leave the house every time you wanted to \\\\nbuy a small essential item, and today with people having to work for long hours, especially in urban cities, \\\\nit is challenging to go out and shop for daily groceries. The market needed an app like Zepto more than it \\\\nwanted one, thus its release was ideal. These apps help customers to save their time  and make their life \\\\neasier. As of right now, as mentioned by the C EO of zepto, they receive 100,000 orders each day, and \\\\ntheir demand curve is essentially flat. They once more turn to technology to determine the ideal location \\\\nfor their tiny fulfilment centres. \\\\nAlthough some would believe that Zepto’ s delivery speed is what sets them apart from the \\\\ncompetition, this is not the case. The key element that sets zepto apart from its rivals is not the quickness \\\\nof the delivery men, but rather how effectively it uses technology. Zepto tracks its customers\\\\\\' spatial data, \\\\ntraffic dynamics, the time it takes to deliver the items, etc. with the aid of www.locus.sh. They collect this \\\\ndata and analyse it to decide whether they need more dark stores in the area to be able to achieve that \\\\n10-minute goal. \\\\nZepto Generates Income in Two Ways \\\\n• It first negotiates a profit margin with the companies based on how much of their product is kept \\\\nin the warehouse. \\\\n• Second, they make money by charging companies for ad space and the top search results. \\\\n• Zepto had total revenue of INR 142.3 Cr in FY22, while incurring costs of INR 532.7 Cr. They \\\\nsuffered a loss of 390.3 Cr INR as a result. \\\\nMarketing costs make up the majority of their spending \\\\nThey invest a lot of money in promoting and advertising their app. During FY22, they spent INR \\\\n175.5 Cr, or almo st 33% of their overall expenses on marketing. In addition to this, the firm spent INR \\\\n213.2 Cr on stock -in-trade purchases in FY22. Employee benefits cost INR 50.3 Cr, while supply chain \\\\ncosts were INR 74 Cr.2 \\\\nZepto’ s EBITDA margin in FY22 was -259.39%.3An EBITDA offers a clear picture of the \\\\ncompany\\\\\\'s worth and displays it to potential buyers and investors. Unfortunately, Zepto’ s EBITDA is \\\\nnegative. \\\\n To distribute the products, Zepto utilizes gig workers. These individuals make an average \\\\nincome of INR 1,30,211.4 \\\\n Zepto has been able to outperform the competition because of its business model. They have a \\\\nhighly effective distribution system, and Zepto’ s AI-powered tools make it simple to manage and keep an \\\\neye on inventory and product selection. This leads to better in ventory management and a wider range of \\\\nproducts. Additionally, they have a large consumer base that is constantly growing. \\\\n \\\\n1  https://www.statista.com/statistics/1021352/india-organized-retail-market-value/https://www.statista.com/topics/5615/food-retail-in \\\\nindia/#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20the%20food%20and%20grocery,retail%20market%20at%2063%20percent . \\\\n2  https://www.vccircle.com/zeptounlikely-to-turn-profitable-in-near-term \\\\n3  https://inc42.com/buzz/zepto-incurs-inr-390-cr-loss-in-first-year-of-operations-fy22-sales-at-inr-\\\\n141r/#:~:text=Zepto%2C%20which%20began%20operations%20in,stood%20at%20INR%20140.7%20Cr . \\\\n4  https://www.ambitionbox.com/salaries/zepto-salaries/delivery-boy \\\\x0cDr. Sunita Gupta & Avani Pandey: Just in 10 Minutes: A Case Study on Zepto 195 \\\\nDiscussion \\\\n Zepto is indeed facing losses but it is only natural for a fledgling enterprise in their early years of \\\\noperations to incur some loss.  While Zepto has suffered losses, it is still in a better situation than Blinkit \\\\nand Dunzo, which have suffered losses of INR 1,019 Cr and INR 464 Cr respectively.1 \\\\nThe quick commerce industry has a customer base that is not very devoted, s o even if delivery \\\\ntime increases by a few minutes, customers will still go where they can obtain the best deals. \\\\n Zepto has to strike a balance between discounts and deals and keep their delivery time between \\\\n10 and 20 minutes. Blinkit is their sole main rival at the moment in this market. They need to start \\\\npenetrating into newer cities if they want to distinctly emerge as the leaders of quick commerce. \\\\nZepto has to diversify its revenue streams and stop relying solely on a limited range of sources. \\\\nAccording to the founders of Zepto, they are planning to open a Zepto café that will provide popular \\\\nbrand’s coffee and tea. If it were to become a reality, it may  be successful since metropolitan city\\\\\\'s youth \\\\nrun on caffeine, and hitting up chaayos or blue tokaievery time you feel like drinking one is impractical. If \\\\nZepto wants to make this business a success, they will need more funding. Since Zepto has already \\\\nestablished a reputation for itself and everything associated with that name would benefit from its \\\\ngoodwill, their marketing costs shouldn\\\\\\'t be too high. \\\\nZepto, as well as any other rapid commerce start -up, solely receives criticism for how it treats \\\\ndelivery guys. Due to the shorter time constraints these workers must adhere to, they may drive rashly, \\\\nincreasing the chances of accidents.  Zepto, however, refutes these criticisms by pointing to their \\\\nadvanced technology, which enables the driver to arrive at the destination both securely and on time. \\\\nSWOT Analysis \\\\nStrengths \\\\n• Excellent usage of technology:  With the assistance of www.locus.sh Zepto records its \\\\ncustomers\\\\\\' geographical data, traffic dynamics, delivery time, and so on. They gather and \\\\nevaluate this data to determine whether more dark establishments are needed in the region to \\\\nmeet the 10-minute objective. \\\\n• Being true to their objective:  Zepto ensures that their customers\\\\\\' expectations are met by \\\\ndelivering goods in 10 minutes. Zepto achieves their ai m 90% of the time, which contributes to \\\\nbrand loyalty. \\\\n• Strong financial support:  Zepto is well -funded, which allows it to expand and grow into a \\\\nmarket leader. They currently have a total funding of $360 million. \\\\n• Competent Workforce: The effective management of Zepto is in the hands of highly skilled and \\\\nexperienced professionals. They are Zepto’ s most valuable resource since they are well -\\\\ninformed about the market. Palicha and Vohra, the co -founders, did a fantastic job in creating \\\\ntheir team. \\\\nWeakness \\\\n• Reliance on retailers: Zepto’s business strategy is primarily dependent on other businesses \\\\nand their inventory. When a retailer\\\\\\'s stock is unavailable, customers may be forced to select a \\\\nhigher-priced substitution or go without buying that item from them. \\\\n• Fluctuating customer base:  To keep their clientele, Zepto must find a balance between their \\\\ndiscount strategy and keeping their delivery time under 10 minutes. \\\\n• Net Income: Zepto’s operational costs are high. They need to grow their sales while decreasing  \\\\nsome of their expenditures to make their business profitable. \\\\n• Nothing Unique: Zepto’s business strategy is not very unique, and any company may enter this \\\\nmarket and replicate it. \\\\n \\\\n1  https://www.vccircle.com/blinkits-marketplace-arm-s-fy22-loss-widens-to-over-rs-1-000-\\\\ncrore#:~:text=Blinkit\\\\\\'s%20marketplace%20arm\\\\\\'s%20FY22%20loss%20widens%20to%20over%20Rs%201%2C000%20crore, -\\\\nBy%20Malvika%20Maloo&text=Zomato%2Downed%20Blinkit\\\\\\'s%20marketplace%20arm,on%20transportation%2C%20contract%\\\\n20and%20advertising. \\\\nhttps://inc42.com/buzz/dunzos-loss-widens-2x-to-inr-464-cr-in-fy22-as-expenses-also-double/#:~:text=Share%20story-\\\\n,Dunzo\\\\\\'s%20Loss%20Widens%202X%20To%20INR%20464,FY22%20As%20E xpenses%20Also%20Double&text=Bengaluru%2\\\\nDbased%20hyperlocal%20delivery%20platform,due%20to%20doubling%20of%20expenses . \\\\n \\\\x0c196 International Journal of Advanced Research in Commerce, Management & Social Science (IJARCMSS)  -October-December, 2022 \\\\nOpportunity \\\\n• Infiltrating further into existing locations and entering fresh  cities: One way they can \\\\noutperform their competitors is to grow their business as quickly as possible. \\\\n• Various Business Ventures:  Zepto has developed a brand identity for itself, which they can \\\\nnow utilize to enter into other sectors and diversify their revenue stream. \\\\nThreats \\\\nHeavy competition: Zepto is in a league with big names. Customers swing from one app to the \\\\nnext like a pendulum. Because there is little consumer loyalty, Zepto must continually stay on top of their \\\\ngame. \\\\n Exploitation of delivery boys: There are several sceptics of the quick commerce industry. \\\\nDelivery boys are exploited in the name of quick delivery and are subjected to extreme strain, increasing \\\\nthe likelihood of an accident. \\\\nConclusion  \\\\nSince its start in April 2021, Zepto has grown organically to become one of India\\\\\\'s most valuable \\\\nand promising start -ups. Zepto has everything a successful firm requires: a talented and dedicated \\\\nworkforce, solid funding, and the use of technology to operate rapidly. However, they cannot handle huge \\\\nsales volume since the dark stores they utilise for speedy delivery are not built to support large scale \\\\noperations. They  keep a limited number of fresh items in hand because if they are not sold, they will \\\\nsuffer losses as the items stale. As a result , there is a possibility that the consumer use competitor\\\\\\'s app \\\\nsince the things they want are out of stock. \\\\nOn the face of it, if Blinkit exists& grows, it is difficult for Zepto  to be the market leader. Both \\\\nhave a nearly identical business model, and Bl inkit’ s delivery time is also less than 10 minutes so \\\\nactually they both don’t have anything unique that sets them apart. The only thing that can help Zepto to \\\\ncompete with Blinkit and become a stable business firm is expanding into more cities and having  a wider \\\\nrange of products to pick from. \\\\nZepto along with other apps is effectively breaking the mould of traditional purchasing and \\\\nestablishing an e-consumerism habit. There is no doubt that Zepto is now expanding faster than anybody \\\\nelse in this sector. They are detail-oriented and employ AI-based technologies well. \\\\nZepto is expected to become a unicorn in 2023. 1However, being a unicorn does not imply that \\\\nthe firm is profitable. \\\\nIn the FY22 their revenue was considerable, as seen by the number of orders they received \\\\neach day, but their operational costs were high and  hence they suffered losses. If they want to become a \\\\nprofitable firm, they must expand into newer cities while adhering to their basic principles and finding \\\\nmethods to reduce their operational expenses. \\\\nReferences  \\\\n1. https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto/news \\\\n2. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/zepto \\\\n3. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zepto-29b1 \\\\n4. https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/grofers-trusted-delivery-partner \\\\n5.

    "## 5.1. Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model | Response Quality | Tool Calling | Response Time | Notes |\n",
    "|-------|------------------|--------------|---------------|-------|\n",
    "| `gemini-2.5-pro-preview` | Excellent | Inconsistent (0-8 calls) | 40s without tools<br>~2m 30s with tools | • Highest quality results<br>• Minimal hallucination<br>• Leverages Google's internal grounding |\n",
    "| `gemini-2.0-flash` | Good | Consistent (up to 8 calls) | 40s-1m depending on tool calls | • Good balance of speed and research depth<br>• Shallow responses can be improved via prompting |\n",
    "| `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` | Basic | Consistent (1-3 calls) | 25-35s | • Fastest response times<br>• Consistently grounded with search results<br>• Most shallow analysis |\n",
    "\n",
    "Our experiment evaluated three Google Gemini models for the research agent prototype, with each showing distinct characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `gemini-2.5-pro-preview`: Produced the highest quality results but struggled with inconsistent tool calling behavior. While it occasionally made up to 8 tool calls resulting in comprehensive research, it frequently failed to utilize tools at all. Response generation took approximately 40 seconds without tool use and up to 2 minutes 30 seconds with tool use. Notably, it demonstrated minimal hallucination even without tool use, potentially due to Google's internal search-based grounding techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `gemini-2.0-flash`: Demonstrated the most consistent tool calling pattern, reliably making up to 8 tool calls per response. While its output quality was superior to the lite version, responses were somewhat shallow - though this could be addressed through prompt engineering. Response times averaged 40 seconds to 1 minute depending on the number of tool calls, offering a good balance between speed and thoroughness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `gemini-2.0-flash-lite`: Delivered the fastest response times (25-35 seconds) but produced the most superficial analyses. All responses were grounded in search tool calls, ensuring factual accuracy despite the limited depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.2. Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "Since our architecture passes agent responses to another agent for downstream processing, both  and `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` are viable candidates. However, `gemini-2.0-flash` emerges as the preferred choice for these reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It makes more comprehensive use of the search tool, gathering a wider range of information\n",
    "2. It produces better quality responses with greater analytical depth\n",
    "3. Its moderate response time (40s-1m) represents an acceptable trade-off for the improved quality\n",
    "4. Further prompt engineering can likely enhance its performance\n",
    "\n",
    "While `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` offers faster processing, the depth and quality of analysis from `gemini-2.0-flash` provides more valuable input for subsequent agent processing. We recommend implementing `gemini-2.0-flash` as the primary model with targeted prompt engineering to optimize its performance."
